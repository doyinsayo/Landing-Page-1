Title: 7 Common Car Problems in Nigeria and Their Solutions
URL: https://smartdrive.com.ng/car-problems-in-nigeria/

Content:
Just like every other machine, a car is bound to have one problem or the other after being used for a while. It doesn’t mean the car brand is inferior or you’re not driving it well. It simply needs maintenance. Here are the 7 most common car problems in Nigeria and their solutions.   A car battery works alongside an alternator to start your vehicle. Generally, automotive batteries are designed to last long (except for electric cars). The battery of most cars that run on fuel usually becomes unusable within 3 to 5 years. A discharged battery is what many car owners have. In such a case, the solution is to take it to a rewire and charge it.   The primary cause of worn-out tires is friction. This can come from multiple sources, but the main determining factor is time. If you travel long distances every week, your tires will be worn out faster than that of a friend who only drives his/her car to the office and back home. A flat tire can also be caused by manufacturing defects, but that’s very rare unless you buy the cheapest tires in the Nigerian market. As sad as it may be, the major cause of flat and worn-out tires is the poor quality of Nigerian roads. There’s no real prevention for this unless you can repair all the potholes present on your route.   Fuel leakage is one of the 7 most common car problems that every car owner should be prepared for. Unlike some other car problems that start unexpectedly, fuel leakages usually start small before becoming a big problem. Aside from increasing the risk of fire accidents, fuel leakages can also expose you to carbon monoxide (CO) . Carbon Monoxide is very dangerous to human health if inhaled in large amounts.    Most problems associated with car breaks are usually caused by friction and low manufacturing quality. You can easily spot a problem with your car braking system. It will create squeaking or grinding sounds each time you apply the brakes. You can also notice a delayed stop. A break problem should never be ignored, as it can lead to serious road accidents.   This is another common car problem in Nigeria. You may experience this frequently if you usually park your car in open spaces. Your car painting will start fading out and chipping from multiple spots. The major causes are ultraviolet rays from exposure to the sun, use of low-quality or powerful cleaning agents, corrosion and aging.    If your car’s exhaust is light or thin white, it is completely normal. This type of smoke is usually water vapour. However, noticing stronger colours calls for rapid attention.  1. White or Grey Smoke This indicates that the coolant is being combusted along with the fuel. There’s a leakage in the Engine block, cylinder head or head gasket. 2. Blue Smoke This colour of the car’s exhaust indicates that there is a leakage in the valve seals or guides. Also, the piston rings may have started wearing out, which will in turn make the engine oil penetrate the combustion chamber. At the end of the day, the oil will burn together with the fuel, thereby causing the blue smoke that you’re noticing. 3. Black Smoke Black smoke indicates excessive fuel being burnt in the combustion chambers. This is usually caused by a leak in the fuel injector, a stuck fuel pressure regulator or a restriction in the fuel combustion pipe.   If your car is old or has been abandoned for a long time, you may notice banging, rattling and splattering noises. Noisy engines can also be noticed if you purchased a low-quality used car. Now let’s talk about overheating. Engine combustion generates a large amount of heat, which is designed to be cooled by radiators. If your cooling system has a fault, it affects your engine indirectly.    With continuous use, your car will develop problems one way or the other. It’s only a matter of time. As a car owner, it’s normal to have your own share of car problems. However, you can’t just ignore the diagnosis/repair as some car issues can compromise your comfort and safety while on the road. To prepare yourself for such occurrences, take note of our list of the 7 most common car problems in Nigeria and their solutions. That way, you can cruise on while being confident in your car, driving skills and most importantly, your own safety. You must be logged in to post a comment.

Title: Automotive Diagnostics Basic Process and Basic Mistakes
URL: https://thetorqueteam.com/automotive-diagnostics-process/

Content:
Choose from our wide range of car, 4WD, diesel and fleet services and repairs. Choose from our range of performance upgrades. When it comes to diagnosing faults, the automotive diagnostics process is both an art and a science. From strange engine noises to dashboard warning lights, every symptom is a clue. But good diagnostics requires more than guesswork—it demands a logical, structured approach. In this article, we’ll walk through the basic diagnostic steps, highlight the common pitfalls even experienced technicians make , and finish with a real-world example to bring it all together. Diagnosing a car fault should follow a clear step-by-step structure: Collect fault information What are the symptoms? Do they happen at certain speeds, temperatures, or times? Confirm the fault Try to recreate or observe the problem—this might involve a road test, checking lights, or inspecting components. Understand the system Know how the system operates and how it interacts with others. Research before testing. Collect more data Use scan tools, visual inspections, and manual measurements to gather detailed information. Analyse and form a theory Consider all causes and weigh the evidence. What fits best? Test to prove or disprove your theory Develop a test plan. If your theory is wrong, go back to step four. Perform the repair Verify the fix Always confirm the issue is resolved after the repair. Many techs skip steps—and it costs them time and accuracy. Here’s where people often go wrong: Jumping to conclusions Skipping analysis leads to the wrong repairs. Don’t go from symptom to solution without testing. Assuming same symptoms = same cause Prior cases help guide you, but each diagnosis is unique. Don’t shortcut the process. Misusing DTCs A fault code is a starting point, not a final answer. For example, P0335 (crankshaft sensor fault) could be a wiring issue, ECU fault, or sensor problem. All must be considered. Trusting opinions over facts Always ask: Does this person understand the system? Can they offer real testing ideas, not just guesses? Ignoring all the evidence Fixating on one clue while missing others can lead you far off track. Use every symptom and test available. Example: Another shop diagnosed a diesel engine with low compression in cylinder 4 and recommended engine replacement. But it idled smoothly, which wouldn’t happen with a bad piston. Our team found a sticking throttle plate causing low air and false compression readings. A simple clean-up solved the issue.  Here’s how the process played out on a 2006 Prius with an intermittent inverter fault: Step 1 – Collecting info: Customer reported power loss on the motorway and warning lights. Step 2 – Confirming the fault: No issue during a test drive, but fault code P0A93 (inverter cooling) was logged. Step 3 – Understanding the system: Visual check confirmed the inverter uses a radiator, coolant, and electric pump. Step 4 – More info: Coolant levels OK. No visible leaks. Pump didn’t respond to scan tool control. Step 5 – Theory: At high loads, pump failure causes inverter to overheat—fits the symptoms. Step 6 – Testing: Power and ground were present at the pump plug. High resistance across pump terminals indicated internal failure. External power supply couldn’t activate the pump either. Step 7 – Repair: Replaced the inverter coolant pump. Step 8 – Verification: New pump vibrated and circulated coolant. Fault fixed. Following a structured automotive diagnostics process saves time, money, and frustration. Avoid jumping to conclusions, use all available evidence, and rely on facts—not assumptions. Whether you’re a DIY enthusiast or a seasoned tech, a systematic approach is your best diagnostic tool. If you’re ever in doubt, seek expert advice —and remember, good diagnostics is about solving problems, not guessing. 18th September 21st August

Registering your car in Nigeria is more than just a legal formality—it helps in reducing crime, enhances security, and ensures road safety compliance. The process involves obtaining a license plate, a registration certificate, and other necessary documents issued by the FRSC. Step 1: Visit the State Licensing Office The first step in the car registration process in Nigeria is visiting the licensing office under the Vehicle Inspection Office (VIO) or State Board of Internal Revenue (SBIR). Step 2: Vehicle Inspection The VIO conducts an inspection of the vehicle to ensure it meets roadworthiness standards. If the vehicle passes, a Roadworthiness Certificate is issued. Step 3: Obtain the Allocation of Plate Number Form You will need to complete an Allocation of Plate Number Form at the licensing office. This form is essential for getting a unique registration number. Step 4: Pay the Required Fees The vehicle registration cost varies depending on the car type and state. Fees include: Number plate fee Vehicle license fee Roadworthiness certificate fee Registration fee Insurance fee These fees range from ₦30,000 to ₦50,000, depending on the vehicle and location.

Title: How Often Should You Rotate Your Tires?

 How Often Should You Rotate Your Tires? Tires are one of the most important parts of your vehicle, yet many car owners in Nigeria overlook proper tire care. One simple but crucial maintenance practice is tire rotation. If you’ve ever wondered, “How often should I rotate my tires?” , this guide will give you expert answers. What is Tire Rotation? Tire rotation is the process of changing the position of each tire on your car, moving the front tires to the back, and the rear tires to the front, sometimes crossing sides. This ensures that all four tires wear out evenly, giving you maximum performance and safety. How Often Should You Rotate Your Tires? Experts recommend rotating your tires every 8,000 – 10,000 kilometers or roughly every 6 months, whichever comes first. However, this may vary depending on: Driving habits – Frequent highway driving, rough roads, or carrying heavy loads may require more frequent rotation. Car type – Front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive, and all-wheel drive vehicles put different pressure on tires. For example, front tires on most cars wear faster because they handle both steering and braking. Tire type – Performance tires or specialized tires may have specific manufacturer recommendations. Always check your car’s owner manual for exact guidance. Why Tire Rotation is Important 1. Extends Tire Life Tires don’t wear evenly. Front tires often wear faster than rear ones. Rotating them ensures even wear, helping you get the most out of your investment. 2. Improves Safety Worn tires can cause poor grip, especially on wet or uneven Nigerian roads. Regular rotation keeps all tires balanced, reducing the risk of blowouts and accidents. 3. Saves You Money Tires are expensive, and replacing them too often can hurt your budget. Regular rotation prevents premature wear, saving you money in the long run. 4. Enhances Fuel Efficiency Unevenly worn tires make your engine work harder, leading to increased fuel consumption. With balanced tires, your car runs smoother and uses less fuel. 5. Better Driving Experience Rotated tires give you smoother rides, better handling, and more stable braking, important when navigating Lagos traffic or long-distance journeys. Signs Your Tires Need Rotation Uneven tread wear Vibrations when driving Noisy tires Reduced handling performance If you notice any of these signs, it’s time to visit RYNO’s workshop. Expert Tip from RYNO Auto At RYNO, we always remind car owners that tire rotation is not optional, it’s essential. Pairing your Toyota, Lexus, Mercedes-Benz, or Range Rover with regular tire care ensures safety and long-term performance. Our certified technicians not only rotate your tires but also check wheel alignment, balancing, and tire pressure to keep your car in top shape. You should rotate your tires every 8,000 – 10,000 km (or 6 months) to extend tire life, improve safety, and save money.

Title: Why You Should Always Buy Trusted Fuel Brands in Nigeria
URL: https://rynoauto.com/why-you-should-always-buy-trusted-fuel-brands-in-nigeria/

Content:
Why You Should Always Buy Trusted Fuel Brands in Nigeria Every car owner in Nigeria knows that fuel is more than just a liquid that powers your car, it’s the lifeblood of your engine. But here’s the truth: not all fuel is created equal. Using low-quality or adulterated petrol can slowly damage your vehicle and cost you thousands in repairs. This is why it is important to always buy from trusted fuel brands in Nigeria. Let’s break down why this matters to every driver. 1. Protects Your Engine from Damage Your car’s engine is its most expensive and important component. Adulterated or diluted fuel often contains impurities that clog fuel injectors, corrode engine parts, and reduce performance. Over time, this leads to engine knocks or even complete failure. Trusted fuel brands follow strict refining and distribution processes, ensuring that the petrol or diesel you buy is clean and safe for your car. 2. Saves You Money on Repairs Many Nigerian drivers don’t realize that bad fuel is one of the leading causes of sudden breakdowns. Repairs for damaged injectors, spark plugs, and fuel pumps are costly. By buying fuel from reliable stations, you reduce the chances of unexpected workshop visits, saving both time and money. 3. Improves Fuel Efficiency With fuel prices constantly rising in Nigeria, efficiency matters. Quality fuel burns cleaner and more effectively, giving you better mileage. This means more kilometers per liter, less waste, and more value for your money. Cheap, untrusted fuel, on the other hand, burns unevenly, forcing your car to consume more. 4. Enhances Driving Performance Have you ever noticed your car jerking, losing power, or struggling to accelerate after refueling? That’s often the result of poor-quality fuel. Using premium fuel from trusted stations helps your car deliver smooth acceleration, stable performance, and overall better driving experience. 5. Ensures Safety and Peace of Mind Fuel adulteration isn’t just bad for your car, it can also be dangerous. Contaminated petrol increases the risk of overheating and even fire hazards. By sticking to reliable fuel stations in Nigeria, you’re protecting not only your car but also your safety and that of your passengers. 6. Trusted Fuel Supports Your Car’s Longevity If you want your Toyota, Lexus, or any other vehicle to last for years, pairing it with the right fuel is a must. Trusted brands maintain global standards, helping your car stay in top condition for longer. RYNO Auto’s Advice to Car Owners At RYNO Auto, we sell brand-new Toyota, Lexus, Mitsubishi, Range Rover, and Mercedes-Benz cars to Nigerians who value quality.

To avoid the various auto repair scams, always make sure you are taking your car to a reputable mechanic with a good reputation.

Home / Blog / Car Tips / Signs Your Fuel Pump Needs Attention Author Published Wed Aug 07 2024 0 comment(s) As car owners, we often take for granted the intricate systems that keep our vehicles running smoothly. One crucial component that plays a significant role in your car's performance is the fuel pump. Responsible for delivering fuel from the tank to the engine, the fuel pump ensures proper combustion and overall operation of your vehicle. At Mechanic on the Go , we understand the importance of a well-functioning fuel pump and how its failure can disrupt your daily routine. Here are some signs to look out for that may indicate your fuel pump needs attention: If your engine hesitates or sputters when you're driving at higher speeds, it could be a sign that your fuel pump is struggling to provide a consistent flow of fuel to the engine. This can result in uneven acceleration and potential safety hazards. A failing fuel pump may struggle to keep up with the demands of your engine, especially during acceleration or when climbing hills. You might experience a noticeable loss of power or sluggishness when you press the accelerator. Conversely, your fuel pump might deliver intermittent surges of fuel to the engine, causing sudden bursts of acceleration or jerking motions. This inconsistency can make driving unpredictable and dangerous. If your car struggles to start or requires multiple attempts before it finally turns over, the fuel pump could be to blame. A weakened fuel pump may not be able to maintain adequate pressure to start the engine reliably. A failing fuel pump can lead to engine stalling, particularly when idling or driving at low speeds. This can leave you stranded and in need of immediate assistance. You might hear a whining or humming noise coming from the rear of your vehicle, near the fuel tank. This noise could indicate that the fuel pump is straining to operate properly. At Mechanic on the Go , we specialise in diagnosing and repairing issues related to your vehicle's fuel system, including the fuel pump. Our team of experienced technicians is equipped with the knowledge and tools necessary to accurately assess the condition of your fuel pump and recommend the best course of action. We understand the inconvenience and frustration that can arise from unexpected car troubles, which is why we prioritise efficiency, transparency, and customer satisfaction in every service we provide.

Home / Blog / Car Tips / How Do I Know if My Car’s Cooling System is Functioning Properly? Author Published Wed Aug 07 2024 0 comment(s) How Do I Know if My Car’s Cooling System is Functioning Properly? As car owners, we rely on our vehicles every day to get us where we need to go safely and reliably. One of the critical components that ensures our cars run smoothly is the cooling system. Responsible for regulating the engine temperature, the cooling system is essential for preventing overheating and maintaining optimal performance. 1. Temperature Gauge: Keep an eye on your car’s temperature gauge. Under normal conditions, it should remain steady in the middle of the gauge. If it starts creeping into the red zone or fluctuating unexpectedly, it could indicate a cooling system problem. 2. Coolant Levels: Check your coolant levels regularly. The coolant reservoir typically has markings indicating the minimum and maximum levels. Ensure the coolant is between these marks when the engine is cool. 3. Coolant Colour and Condition: Healthy coolant is usually bright-coloured (green, orange, pink, etc.) and free of debris. If you notice discoloration, particles, or rust in the coolant, it may be time for a flush and replacement. 4. Visible Leaks: Look under your car for any signs of coolant leaks. Puddles of coolant under the vehicle or around the radiator or hoses can indicate a leak that needs immediate attention. 5. Steam or Smoke: If you see steam or smoke coming from under the hood, it could indicate overheating. Pull over safely, turn off the engine, and wait for it to cool down before inspecting further. At Mechanic on the Go , we understand the importance of a reliable cooling system. Our team of expert mechanics specialises in diagnosing and repairing cooling system issues efficiently and effectively. Here’s why you can trust us with your car’s cooling system: 1.

Title: How Do I Maintain My Car’s Battery?

Home / Blog / Car Tips / How Do I Maintain My Car’s Battery? Author Published Wed Aug 07 2024 0 comment(s) At Mechanic on the Go , we understand how vital a well-maintained car battery is to your vehicle’s performance and reliability. A healthy battery ensures your car starts smoothly, electronics run efficiently, and you avoid inconvenient breakdowns. Here’s a comprehensive guide on how to maintain your car’s battery to keep it in top condition. One of the simplest ways to maintain your car battery is through regular inspections. Check the battery terminals for corrosion (a white, ashy substance) and ensure that the connections are tight. Corrosion can be cleaned with a mixture of baking soda and water, but if you’re unsure, our experts at Mechanic on the Go are always here to help. Dirt and grime can conduct electricity, which could potentially drain your battery’s power. Regularly cleaning your battery with a damp cloth can prevent dirt from accumulating. Avoid using excessive water, as it can cause rust or other damage. If your car sits idle for extended periods, the battery can lose charge and eventually die. Driving your car regularly, even for short trips, helps keep the battery charged. If you don’t drive your car often, consider using a trickle charger to maintain the battery’s charge. Frequent short trips can prevent your battery from fully charging. Aim to drive for at least 20 minutes to allow the alternator to recharge the battery fully. Combining errands into one longer trip can help keep your battery in good shape. Turn off all lights, the radio, and other electronics when the engine is not running to avoid draining the battery. Modern cars have features that automatically turn off lights, but it’s always good to double-check before leaving your vehicle. A fully charged car battery should read around 12.6 volts or more. You can check the voltage with a multi-meter. If the reading is below 12.4 volts, your battery may need charging or replacement. If you’re not comfortable checking this yourself, bring your car to Mechanic on the Go, and we’ll be happy to do it for you. Both extreme heat and cold can affect your battery’s performance. During hot summers, park in the shade or garage to avoid overheating. In cold winters, keeping your car in a garage can prevent the battery from freezing. If you live in an area with severe temperatures, consider a battery blanket for extra protection. A loose battery can vibrate, potentially leading to damage and short circuits. Make sure your battery is securely fastened in its tray. If you notice any issues with the battery's placement, our team at Mechanic on the Go can quickly secure it for you. Car batteries typically last 3 to 5 years. If your battery is nearing the end of its lifespan, it’s wise to replace it before it fails completely. Regular maintenance checks can help identify when it’s time for a new battery. Maintaining your car’s battery is essential for reliable performance and avoiding unexpected breakdowns. At Mechanic on the Go , we offer comprehensive battery checks, cleaning, and replacement services to ensure your vehicle runs smoothly. Our experienced technicians are dedicated to providing top-notch service and keeping you on the road with confidence. If you have any concerns about your car’s battery or need a professional inspection, don’t hesitate to contact us.

Home / Blog / Car Tips / Understanding Brake Fluid Maintenance: Your Car's Safety Depends on It Author Published Tue Aug 06 2024 0 comment(s) Understanding Brake Fluid Maintenance: Your Car's Safety Depends on It At Mechanic on the Go , we understand the importance of keeping your vehicle in peak condition. As your trusted auto repair specialists, we often get asked, "How often should I change my brake fluid?" It's a critical question that directly impacts your safety on the road. Let's dive into why brake fluid maintenance matters and what you need to know. Why Brake Fluid Matters Brake fluid is often overlooked but plays a vital role in your car's braking system. It transfers the force from your foot on the brake pedal to the actual brakes at each wheel. Over time, brake fluid can absorb moisture from the air, which lowers its boiling point and compromises its effectiveness. This moisture can also lead to corrosion within the braking system, potentially causing costly damage. When Should You Change Your Brake Fluid? Manufacturers typically recommend changing brake fluid every 2 years or 30,000 miles, whichever comes first. However, this can vary depending on your driving habits and the climate you live in. If you frequently drive in stop-and-go traffic or live in a humid area, your brake fluid may degrade faster. Signs That Your Brake Fluid Needs Attention Trust Mechanic on the Go for Your Brake Fluid Needs When it's time for brake fluid maintenance, trust Mechanic on the Go to handle it professionally. Our certified technicians use high-quality brake fluids and follow manufacturer guidelines to ensure your safety and peace of mind. We make it easy and convenient with our mobile service, coming to you wherever you are, whether at home or work. Why Choose Us?

Don't wait until you notice a problem; regular maintenance can prevent costly repairs and keep you safe. Contact Mechanic on the Go today to schedule your brake fluid service and experience the difference our expertise can make. Trust us to keep your vehicle running smoothly and safely, mile after mile.

Home / Blog / Car Tips / Signs of Worn-Out Shocks or Struts Author Published Tue Aug 06 2024 0 comment(s) As a responsible car owner, you understand the importance of keeping your vehicle in top condition. One crucial aspect often overlooked is the health of your shocks and struts. These components play a vital role in your car’s stability, handling, and overall safety. Recognising the signs of worn-out shocks or struts can save you from potential headaches and ensure a smoother driving experience. 1. Bumpy Ride: Have you noticed your car bouncing excessively over bumps or dips in the road? This is often one of the earliest signs that your shocks or struts are wearing out. Normally, these components absorb the impact of uneven surfaces, providing a comfortable ride. When they start to fail, you'll feel every imperfection on the road. 2. Nose Dives and Rear Squats: Pay attention to how your car behaves when you brake or accelerate. If you experience noticeable forward dips (nose dives) when braking or rear-end squats when accelerating, it could indicate worn-out shocks or struts. These parts help to maintain your car's posture during such maneuvers, and their deterioration can affect both comfort and safety. 3. Uneven Tire Wear: Keep an eye on your tires. Excessive or uneven tire wear can be a sign of various issues, including misaligned wheels or worn-out shocks and struts. When these components are no longer effectively absorbing shocks, your tires bear more of the impact, leading to premature wear and potentially compromising your safety on the road. 4. Steering Responsiveness: Are you noticing increased difficulty in steering or a feeling of instability while driving? Worn-out shocks or struts can affect how your car responds to steering inputs, making it feel less stable and controlled. This can be particularly noticeable when taking corners or navigating tight turns. 5. Fluid Leaks or Visible Damage: Take a peek under your car. Any signs of fluid leaks around the shock or strut assemblies should be investigated promptly. Leakage indicates internal wear and can lead to further damage if left unchecked. Additionally, visible physical damage to these components, such as dents or rust, is a clear indication that they may need attention. Why Choose Mechanic on the Go ?

Home / Blog / Car Tips / How Can I Improve My Car’s Fuel Efficiency? Author Published Fri Aug 02 2024 0 comment(s) In today’s world, fuel efficiency isn’t just about saving money—it’s about being kind to the environment too. At Mechanic on the Go, we understand that every mile per gallon counts, and we’re here to help you get the most out of every drop of fuel. Here are some practical tips to improve your car’s fuel efficiency and why choosing us for your auto maintenance needs can make all the difference. A well-maintained engine runs more efficiently. Regular oil changes, timely replacement of air filters, and ensuring your spark plugs are in good condition can significantly improve fuel efficiency. At Mechanic on the Go, our experts perform thorough engine checks and maintenance to keep your vehicle running smoothly. Under-inflated tires can decrease fuel efficiency by up to 3%. Regularly checking and maintaining the correct tire pressure can not only save fuel but also extend the life of your tires. Our mobile service can come to you and ensure your tires are always at their optimal pressure. Carrying excess weight in your car can reduce fuel efficiency. Clear out unnecessary items from your trunk and back seat. If you need help with larger items or vehicle modifications, our team is ready to assist you with practical solutions. Aggressive driving, such as rapid acceleration and braking, can lower your gas mileage by 15-30% on highways and 10-40% in city driving. Our driving tips and training sessions can help you adopt a smoother driving style, ultimately saving you money at the pump. When driving on highways, using cruise control can help maintain a constant speed and, in turn, save fuel. If your cruise control isn’t working correctly, our technicians can diagnose and fix the issue quickly. Idling for long periods can waste a significant amount of fuel. If you’re waiting for more than a minute, it’s more efficient to turn off your engine. We can help ensure your vehicle starts reliably every time, making it easier to follow this tip. Combine errands into one trip and plan your routes to avoid traffic and unnecessary backtracking. Efficient trip planning can reduce the distance you drive and improve your overall fuel economy. Using the manufacturer’s recommended grade of motor oil can improve fuel efficiency by 1-2%.

Title: Why Your Gearbox Should Be Replaced, Not Repaired

Home / Blog / Car Tips / Why Your Gearbox Should Be Replaced, Not Repaired Author Published Thu Aug 01 2024 0 comment(s)  As a car owner, you know the importance of keeping your vehicle in top condition. Regular maintenance and timely repairs can keep your car running smoothly and safely. One critical component that often gets overlooked until it causes significant issues is the gearbox. At Mechanic on the Go, we believe in providing you with the best possible service, which is why we recommend replacing, rather than repairing, your gearbox when problems arise. Here’s why: When your gearbox starts malfunctioning, it’s often a sign of significant wear and tear. Repairing the gearbox might offer a temporary fix, but it doesn’t address the root cause of the problem. By opting for a replacement, you ensure that all the internal components are brand new and functioning correctly, providing long-term reliability and peace of mind. A repaired gearbox is more likely to experience recurring issues. Since only the faulty parts are replaced, other worn-out components may soon fail, leading to further repairs and expenses. Replacing the entire gearbox eliminates the risk of such issues, ensuring your car operates smoothly without frequent breakdowns. A new gearbox can significantly improve your vehicle’s performance. Over time, worn-out gears and components can reduce efficiency, affecting acceleration and fuel economy. By replacing the gearbox, you restore your car’s original performance levels, making your driving experience more enjoyable and efficient. While repairing a gearbox might seem like a cost-effective solution in the short term, it can end up costing you more in the long run. Frequent repairs and the potential for further damage can add up quickly. Replacing the gearbox is a more cost-effective solution over time, saving you money on repeated repairs and associated inconveniences. Many car manufacturers recommend replacing the gearbox rather than repairing it, especially for newer models. This recommendation is based on the understanding that modern gearboxes are complex systems, and a full replacement is often more reliable than attempting to repair individual components. When you opt for a gearbox replacement, you often receive a warranty or guarantee on the new part. This provides added assurance that any future issues will be covered, offering you extra protection and value. Repairs, on the other hand, may not come with the same level of warranty, leaving you vulnerable to further costs. A malfunctioning gearbox can pose serious safety risks. Sudden gear failures or unpredictable behaviour can lead to dangerous situations on the road. Replacing the gearbox ensures that your vehicle remains safe to drive, protecting you, your passengers, and other road users. At Mechanic on the Go , we understand the importance of reliable, safe, and cost-effective solutions for your vehicle. Our experienced technicians are committed to providing top-quality service and ensuring your car is in optimal condition. By choosing us for your gearbox replacement, you’re making a wise investment in your vehicle’s longevity and performance. Don’t wait for minor gearbox issues to turn into major problems. Contact Mechanic on the Go today to schedule your gearbox replacement and experience the difference in your car’s performance and reliability. Trust us to keep you on the road, worry-free.

Title: How Do I Know When My Car Needs an Oil Change?

Home / Blog / Car Tips / How Do I Know When My Car Needs an Oil Change? Author Published Thu Aug 01 2024 0 comment(s) How Do I Know When My Car Needs an Oil Change? As a car owner, keeping your vehicle in top shape is essential for ensuring its longevity and performance. One of the most critical maintenance tasks is changing your car’s oil regularly. But how do you know when it’s time for an oil change? At Mechanic on the Go, we want to help you understand the signs that indicate your car needs fresh oil. Before we dive into the signs, let’s talk about why oil changes are so important. Oil is the lifeblood of your engine. It lubricates moving parts, reduces friction, helps keep the engine cool, and prevents dirt and debris from causing damage. Over time, oil breaks down and becomes less effective, which can lead to increased wear and tear on your engine.  Modern cars are equipped with sensors that monitor the condition of your oil. If your dashboard’s oil change light comes on, it’s a clear sign that your car needs an oil change. The check engine light can also indicate low oil levels, which can cause engine damage if not addressed promptly. Fresh oil provides a protective layer between engine parts. When the oil becomes old and dirty, it loses its lubricating properties, leading to increased friction. This can cause your engine to make unusual noises, such as knocking or rumbling.  You can check the condition of your oil by pulling out the dipstick and wiping it with a clean cloth. Fresh oil is typically amber and translucent. Over time, it turns dark and dirty as it collects particles and debris. If your oil looks thick and grimy, it’s time for a change. If you smell oil inside your car, it could mean there’s a leak or that the oil is burning due to overheating. Both situations require immediate attention. An oil leak can lead to a drop in oil levels, while burning oil can cause engine damage.  While a small amount of translucent vapor from the exhaust is normal, blue or gray smoke is not. This could indicate that oil is leaking into the engine or the exhaust system. If you notice smoke, it’s essential to get your car checked right away. Most car manufacturers recommend changing the oil every 3,000 to 5,000 miles, but this can vary based on your vehicle and driving habits. Check your owner’s manual for the recommended oil change interval. If you’ve driven more miles than suggested, it’s time for an oil change. At Mechanic on the Go , we understand that maintaining your car can sometimes feel overwhelming. That’s why we’re here to make it easy for you. Our team of skilled mechanics is ready to come to your location and provide top-notch service, whether you need an oil change or any other maintenance. Don’t wait for the signs to become problems. Schedule your oil change with Mechanic on the Go today and experience the convenience and reliability of our mobile service. Keeping your car in top condition has never been easier.

Home / Blog / Car Tips / Guide to Finding Reliable Car Mechanics in Nigerian Cities Author Published Thu Jul 25 2024 1 comment(s) Owning a car comes with its joys and responsibilities. One of the most crucial aspects of car ownership is finding a reliable mechanic who can keep your vehicle running smoothly. Whether you're in Lagos or any other Nigerian city, knowing how to choose the right mechanic can save you time, money, and ensure your safety on the road. Start your search by asking friends, family, and colleagues for recommendations. Personal referrals are often the best way to find a trustworthy mechanic. People are usually happy to share their positive experiences with mechanics who have provided excellent service. In this digital age, online reviews can provide valuable insights into a mechanic's reputation. Websites like Google Reviews, Facebook, and specialised review platforms can give you an idea of what other customers think about a particular auto repair shop. Look for consistently high ratings and positive comments about customer service, pricing, and quality of work. Ensure that the mechanics and technicians at the repair shop are properly trained and certified. Look for certifications from reputable organisations such as the Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) or manufacturer-specific certifications. Experience in handling your car make and model is also a plus. Take a trip to the mechanic's shop before committing to any service. Pay attention to the cleanliness and organisation of the facility. A well-maintained shop often reflects attention to detail and professionalism. Additionally, observe how the staff interacts with customers and whether they are willing to answer your questions. A reputable mechanic will often provide warranties or guarantees on their work. Inquire about the specific terms of these guarantees and what they cover. This demonstrates the mechanic's confidence in their abilities and commitment to customer satisfaction. Before agreeing to any repairs, obtain estimates from multiple mechanics. This allows you to compare prices and services offered. Be wary of significantly lower prices as they may indicate substandard parts or workmanship. Ultimately, trust your instincts when choosing a mechanic. If something doesn’t feel right or if you’re not comfortable with the explanations provided, consider seeking a second opinion. A good mechanic will prioritise transparency and ensure you fully understand the repairs needed. Finding a reliable car mechanic in Nigerian cities like Lagos doesn’t have to be daunting. By following these steps—seeking recommendations, checking reviews, verifying credentials, visiting the shop, asking about warranties, getting estimates, and trusting your instincts—you can make an informed decision. At Mechanic on the Go , we prioritise transparency, quality service, and customer satisfaction. Trust us with your car care needs, and we’ll ensure your vehicle stays in optimal condition on Nigeria’s roads. Ready to experience hassle-free car maintenance? Contact Mechanic on the Go today!

Ensure that your coolant levels are always topped up to the manufacturer's specifications. If you're unsure about how to check or refill coolant, our team is here to assist you.  Belts and hoses can wear out over time, leading to coolant leaks or inefficient cooling system operation. Regularly inspect these components and replace them as needed to prevent unexpected breakdowns.  Pay attention to your vehicle's temperature gauge while driving. If you notice it creeping into the red zone or your dashboard warning light comes on, it's a sign of potential overheating. Pull over safely, turn off your engine, and let it cool down before continuing.  If possible, plan your routes to avoid heavy traffic congestion, especially during peak hours and in areas prone to gridlock. Stop-and-go traffic can significantly increase your engine's temperature, so keeping moving whenever possible can help prevent overheating. While air conditioning provides comfort, it also puts an additional load on your engine. Use it judiciously, especially in stop-and-go traffic, to reduce strain on your cooling system.  Engine oil plays a crucial role in lubricating and cooling your engine. Ensure that your oil levels are adequate and that you follow the manufacturer's recommendations for oil changes to maintain optimal engine performance. Preventive maintenance is the best way to avoid overheating issues. Schedule regular service appointments with Mechanic on the Go to keep your vehicle in peak condition. Our skilled technicians will ensure that your cooling system and other vital components are functioning correctly.

Home / Blog / Car Tips / How to Maintain Your Car in Nigeria's Climate Author Published Wed Jul 17 2024 0 comment(s) How to Maintain Your Car in Nigeria's Climate Living in Nigeria means experiencing a diverse range of weather conditions, from the scorching heat of the dry season to the heavy rains of the wet season. These varying conditions can take a toll on your vehicle, making proper maintenance crucial to keep your car running smoothly. At Mechanic on the Go, we understand the unique challenges Nigerian drivers face and are here to help you navigate them. Here’s a comprehensive guide on how to maintain your car in Nigeria’s climate.  Nigeria’s climate can cause your engine oil to break down faster than in more temperate regions. Regular oil changes are essential to keep your engine lubricated and running efficiently. We recommend checking your oil levels frequently and changing your oil every 5,000 kilometres or as specified by your vehicle’s manufacturer.  The intense heat can lead to your engine overheating if your cooling system is not in top shape. Ensure that your radiator is functioning correctly and that the coolant levels are adequate. Regularly check for leaks in the radiator and hoses, and consider flushing the cooling system every two years to remove any buildup that could impede its performance.  Nigeria’s rough and varied road conditions can wear out your tires quickly. Regularly check your tire pressure and ensure it is at the recommended level. Rotate your tires every 10,000 kilometres to promote even wear, and keep an eye out for any signs of damage or excessive wear. Adequate tire maintenance will not only improve your vehicle’s performance but also enhance your safety on the road.  The combination of high temperatures and humidity can shorten your car battery’s lifespan. Regularly inspect your battery for corrosion on the terminals and clean them as needed. Ensure the battery is securely mounted and check the fluid levels if applicable. If your battery is more than three years old, consider having it tested to avoid unexpected failures.  Driving in Nigeria often involves navigating through traffic and dealing with sudden stops. This makes it crucial to keep your brake system in excellent condition. Regularly check your brake pads for wear and tear, and have them replaced when necessary. Additionally, ensure that the brake fluid is at the proper level and free from contamination. The intense sun and heavy rains can damage your car’s paint and exterior. Regular washing and waxing can help protect your vehicle’s finish from the elements. Consider parking in shaded areas or using a car cover to shield your car from the sun’s UV rays and reduce the risk of paint fading and cracking.  A functioning air conditioning system is a must in Nigeria’s hot climate. Regularly check the refrigerant levels and have the system inspected for any leaks or issues. Keeping your air conditioning system in good shape will not only keep you comfortable but also prevent any potential damage to the system components. The heavy rains during the wet season can severely impact your visibility while driving. Ensure your windshield wipers are in good condition and replace them if they show signs of wear. Additionally, keep your washer fluid topped up to help clear any dirt or debris that accumulates on your windshield. Nigeria’s roads can be quite challenging, putting a strain on your vehicle’s suspension system. Regularly inspect your shock absorbers, struts, and other suspension components for any signs of wear or damage. Addressing any issues promptly will ensure a smoother and safer ride. Finally, regular inspections by a professional mechanic are essential to catch any potential issues before they become major problems. At Mechanic on the Go, we offer comprehensive inspection services tailored to the specific needs of Nigerian drivers. Our experienced technicians will ensure your car is in top condition, giving you peace of mind on the road. Maintaining your car in Nigeria’s climate requires a proactive approach and attention to detail. By following these tips and relying on the expertise of Mechanic on the Go, you can keep your vehicle running smoothly and efficiently, no matter the weather conditions. Schedule your next maintenance appointment with us today and experience the difference of professional, reliable service. No comments.

Home / Blog / Car Tips / The Ultimate Guide to Buying a Used Car in Nigeria Author Published Wed Jul 17 2024 0 comment(s)  Buying a used car can be an exciting yet daunting experience, especially in Nigeria, where the market is diverse and sometimes unpredictable. At Mechanic on the Go, we understand the challenges car buyers face and are here to provide you with the ultimate guide to help you make an informed and confident decision. Our goal is to gain your trust and make sure you come to us for any issues or questions you may have during your car-buying journey. Before you start searching for a used car, it’s crucial to set a realistic budget. Consider not only the purchase price but also additional costs such as insurance, registration, and potential repairs. Knowing your budget will help you narrow down your options and prevent you from overspending. Familiarize yourself with the types of cars available in the Nigerian market. Popular choices include Toyota, Honda, and Hyundai due to their reliability and availability of spare parts. Use online platforms, visit car dealerships, and attend car fairs to gather information about different makes and models. Once you’ve found a potential car, it’s essential to check its history. Verify the car’s registration documents, service records, and previous ownership. Be cautious of cars with a history of accidents or major repairs. Websites like AutoCheck Nigeria can provide you with detailed vehicle history reports. A thorough inspection is crucial to avoid future problems. Here’s a checklist to guide you: At Mechanic on the Go, we offer pre-purchase inspections to give you peace of mind. Our expert mechanics will thoroughly inspect the car and provide you with a detailed report.   Low mileage is generally preferable, but be wary of cars with unusually low mileage for their age, as the odometer may have been tampered with. Compare the mileage with the car’s service records to ensure consistency. Don’t be afraid to negotiate the price. Use the information you’ve gathered from your research and inspection to justify your offer. Be prepared to walk away if the seller isn’t willing to meet a reasonable price.  Make sure all necessary paperwork is in order before finalizing the purchase. This includes the bill of sale, transfer of ownership, and any warranty documents. It’s advisable to have a trusted mechanic or legal expert review the documents to ensure everything is legitimate.   Once you’ve purchased the car, arrange for insurance immediately. Compare quotes from different insurance companies to find the best coverage for your needs. Comprehensive insurance is recommended to protect you from potential risks. Regular maintenance is key to keeping your used car in good condition. At Mechanic on the Go, we offer a range of services, including oil changes, brake inspections, and tire rotations, to ensure your car runs smoothly.

Title: Must-Have Accessories for Nigerian Car Owners

Home / Blog / Car Tips / Must-Have Accessories for Nigerian Car Owners Author Published Wed Jul 17 2024 0 comment(s) Owning a car in Nigeria is both a convenience and a necessity. However, to ensure a smooth driving experience and to be prepared for any unexpected situations, equipping your car with the right accessories is essential. At Mechanic on the Go, we understand the unique challenges Nigerian drivers face and are here to provide you with a list of must-have accessories that can enhance your driving experience and safety on the road. A dashboard camera, or dash cam, is an invaluable tool for Nigerian drivers. It records everything that happens on the road, providing crucial evidence in case of accidents or disputes. A dash cam can also help you monitor the behaviour of your driver if you have one, ensuring they adhere to safe driving practices.  A well-stocked first aid kit is a necessity for every car owner. In the event of minor accidents or injuries, having immediate access to medical supplies can make a significant difference. Ensure your kit includes bandages, antiseptic wipes, pain relievers, and other essential items.  Road conditions in Nigeria can be unpredictable, making a flat tire a common occurrence. Always have a spare tire, jack, and lug wrench in your car. Knowing how to change a tire can save you from being stranded in inconvenient or unsafe locations.  A dead battery can happen to anyone, especially in Nigeria’s hot climate, which can drain car batteries faster. Jumper cables are a must-have to get your car running again. They allow you to jump-start your car using another vehicle’s battery, saving you time and money.  Maintaining the correct tire pressure is crucial for safe driving and fuel efficiency. A portable tire inflator lets you inflate your tires on the go, ensuring you’re never stuck with a flat tire. This is particularly useful for long road trips or when driving through areas with few service stations.  Car fires, though rare, can happen and are extremely dangerous. A compact fire extinguisher designed for automotive use can help you quickly address small fires before they become uncontrollable. Regularly check that your extinguisher is fully charged and easily accessible.  An emergency roadside kit can be a lifesaver in case of a breakdown. It typically includes reflective triangles, a flashlight, batteries, a multi-tool, and other essentials. These items can help you stay safe and visible while waiting for assistance.  Using your phone while driving is dangerous and illegal in many places, including Nigeria. A phone mount allows you to keep your hands on the wheel while using your phone for navigation. It also helps keep your phone secure and within easy reach.  Protecting your car’s interior from dirt, spills, and wear is important, especially if you frequently drive on dusty or muddy roads. Quality seat covers and floor mats can keep your car looking new and make cleaning much easier.  Nigeria’s air quality can vary greatly, especially in urban areas with heavy traffic. A car air purifier helps to keep the air inside your car clean and free from pollutants, allergens, and unpleasant odours, providing a healthier driving environment. At Mechanic on the Go, we not only provide top-notch repair services but also offer expert advice to keep your car in optimal condition. Our team of experienced mechanics is always ready to assist you with any automotive issues you may encounter.

Home / Blog / Car Tips / Essential Car Maintenance Checklist for Nigerian Drivers Author Published Wed Jul 17 2024 0 comment(s) Keeping your car in top shape is essential, especially with the unique driving conditions in Nigeria. Whether navigating the bustling streets of Lagos or the rugged roads of the countryside, regular maintenance is key to ensuring your vehicle's longevity and your safety. At Mechanic on the Go, we're dedicated to providing top-notch auto repair services to keep you on the road. Here’s an essential car maintenance checklist tailored for Nigerian drivers to help you stay on top of your vehicle’s needs.  Changing your car’s oil regularly is crucial. It keeps your engine running smoothly and efficiently. Check your owner's manual for the recommended oil change interval, but typically, it's every 5,000 to 7,500 kilometres. Using high-quality oil is essential, especially in the hot and dusty conditions common in Nigeria.   The air filter prevents dust and debris from entering your engine. Given Nigeria's dusty environment, it’s important to check and replace your air filter more frequently. A clogged air filter can reduce engine performance and fuel efficiency. Regularly check all your car’s fluids, including brake fluid, transmission fluid, power steering fluid, coolant, and windshield washer fluid. Ensuring these are at the correct levels can prevent major issues and keep your car running smoothly.  Your brakes are crucial for your safety. Regularly inspect brake pads, rotors, and brake fluid. If you notice any squeaking or reduced braking performance, it’s time to visit Mechanic on the Go for a professional check-up.  Properly inflated and maintained tires are vital. Check your tire pressure monthly and ensure they’re inflated to the manufacturer’s recommended levels. Also, look out for tread wear and rotate your tires every 10,000 kilometres to ensure even wear.  The battery is the heart of your car’s electrical system. Extreme temperatures can affect its performance. Regularly check for corrosion on the terminals and ensure it holds a charge. If your car struggles to start, it may be time for a new battery. Ensure all your lights, including headlights, brake lights, and indicators, are functioning correctly. Regularly inspect your vehicle’s electrical system to avoid issues with starting your car or other electrical functions.  Nigeria's roads can be tough on your car’s suspension and steering systems. Regularly check for any unusual noises or vibrations and ensure your steering is responsive. If you notice any issues, visit Mechanic on the Go for a thorough inspection.  Your car’s cooling system prevents the engine from overheating. Regularly check the coolant level and inspect hoses and the radiator for any signs of leaks or damage. Flushing the coolant system as per the manufacturer’s recommendation is also essential. Even with regular DIY checks, it’s important to have your car inspected by a professional mechanic periodically. At Mechanic on the Go, our experts can identify potential issues before they become major problems, ensuring your vehicle stays in peak condition. Staying on top of these maintenance tasks can save you from unexpected breakdowns and expensive repairs. At Mechanic on the Go , we’re here to assist with all your auto repair and maintenance needs.

We advise our customers to have their tires re-aligned properly 5000-6000 Kilometers and every time you buy a new set of tires.  Brake Problems: Brake issues, such as warped rotors, can induce vibrations when you apply the brakes. Your brakes are very crucial for your safety. Hence, if your steering wheel is shaky, it is definitely a safety hazard.   Wheel Alignment and Balancing: Have your wheels balanced to ensure even weight distribution, eliminating vibrations caused by wheel imbalance. As said earlier, every 5-6k Kilometers.  Tire Inspection: The best way to know your tires are in the best condition for use is to inspect them. In our comprehensive services , we ensure a thorough tire inspection of our customers’ vehicles at Mechanic On The Go.

Your tires are the only part of your car making direct contact with the road, or at least they’re supposed to be the only part👀. If they are not maintained properly, they put you at risk of not being able to move the car at all and also at risk of having accidents.    Safety: Ensuring that your tires are maintained properly, is vital to your safety. Your tire is the literal foundation of your car, hence you can imagine how unsafe it would be to have a shaky foundation…  Improved Fuel Efficiency: Properly inflated and aligned tires lead to better fuel economy, saving you money at the pump.

It is cost-effective to check that your tires are well maintained, to avoid spending unnecessarily extravagant fees on replacing your tires too soon.

Proper Inflation: Maintain the recommended tire pressure as specified by your vehicle's manufacturer to ensure even wear and safe handling.  Tire Rotation: Tire rotation involves moving the tires at the back to the front, and vice-versa. Regularly rotate your tires to promote even tread wear and extend their lifespan.

Home / Blog / Maintenance / What is the use of My Car’s Oil Filter? Author Published Thu Oct 19 2023 0 comment(s) Your car's oil filter might seem like a negligible part of the car but don’t be deceived, it’s very very important in the day-to-day running of your car. In this post, we take a deep dive into this important part!   Engine Protection: The oil filter is a guardian of your car's engine, responsible for trapping contaminants and debris that can harm critical engine components. It’s like a sieve, harmful things stay away, good things keep flowing!  Clean Oil Circulation : It ensures a continuous flow of clean oil and this clean oil is vital for lubricating engine parts and reducing friction.   How Does the Oil Filter Work? Filtration: As engine oil circulates through the filter, it passes through a porous medium designed to capture particles like dirt, debris, and metal fragments.  Cleansing: The filter holds these contaminants, preventing them from circulating through the engine and causing wear and damage.   There are so many vital reasons to take good care of your oil filter, here are two major reasons: Dusty Conditions: In a country like Nigeria especially, climate and road conditions can lead to increased dust and debris on the roads, making a reliable oil filter crucial to maintaining engine health. As we would say in Nigeria, “They no dey tell person!”  Traffic Congestion: Frequent stop-and-go traffic, especially in urban areas, can put extra stress on engines. A clean oil filter ensures that your engine receives optimal lubrication.   Regular Replacement: At Mechanic On The Go , our essential and comprehensive services include proper check and replacement of Oil filters. We understand the importance of this!  Quality Matters: Choose a high-quality oil filter to guarantee optimal filtration and protection for your engine. Once again, at MOTG we ensure that we use only the best and you can reachout to us for help with this!  Frequent Inspections: Periodically inspect your oil filter for signs of clogging or damage. Early detection can prevent engine problems.   In summary, the oil filter is a small but vital component for your car's engine health. Don't let contaminants and debris compromise your engine's performance and longevity. Oil filter issues or car issues in general?

Home / Blog / Car Info / What is the use of your car’s spark plug? Author Published Thu Oct 12 2023 0 comment(s)   Spark plugs have two major purposes in a car; Igniting Combustion: Spark plugs are a key feature in igniting the air-fuel mixture within the engine's cylinders. This controlled ignition generates the power needed to move your car.  AND  Fuel Efficiency: Fuel prices seem to be increasing nearly everyday. However, with properly functioning spark plugs, you can ensure efficient combustion in your car, leading to better fuel economy and reduced emissions. Again, small but mighty!   Copper Spark Plugs: Affordable and effective, these spark plugs offer good conductivity but have a shorter lifespan compared to other types.  Iridium Spark Plugs: Known for their longevity and consistent performance, iridium spark plugs are a popular choice for modern engines.  Platinum Spark Plugs: Platinum plugs strike a balance between performance and durability, making them a reliable option for many vehicles.  You should definitely contact a trusted mechanic, particularly at Mechanic On The Go to get more info on these.   Rough Idling: Idling simply means your car engine is turned on but your car is not in motion. If your car idles roughly or shakes, it could be due to worn spark plugs.  Reduced Fuel Efficiency: As said earlier, spark plugs contribute to your car’s fuel efficiency so if you notice your car being less-efficient than normal, you should get them checked.  Misfiring : Frequent engine misfires, indicated by a jerking sensation or loss of power, may be a sign of spark plug issues.   Regular Inspection : Routine checks help identify worn or fouled spark plugs. At Mechanic On The Go we carry out checks on our customers’ spark plugs to ensure they remain in top working condition.  Proper Installation: When replacing spark plugs, ensure they are correctly gapped and tightened to the manufacturer's specifications.  Quality Matters : Invest in high-quality spark plugs to ensure longevity and optimal performance. Better to spend big at once for quality than to spend peanuts and end up dancing to the tune of incompetent spark plugs.   In summary, we hope we’ve been able to convince you and not confuse you that spark plugs are very important to your car(s).  For all your spark plug maintenance and replacement needs, do well to reach out to us at Mechanic On The Go . We have skilled technicians who ensure that your car is in top top shape at all times!

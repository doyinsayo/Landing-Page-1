    "content": "Home / Blog/ Car Tips / Signs Your Fuel Pump Needs Attention Author Published Wed Aug 07 2024 0 comment(s) As car owners, we often take for granted the intricate systems that keep our vehicles running smoothly. One crucial component that plays a significant role in your car's performance is the fuel pump. Responsible for delivering fuel from the tank to the engine, the fuel pump ensures proper combustion and overall operation of your vehicle. At Mechanic on the Go, we understand the importance of a well-functioning fuel pump and how its failure can disrupt your daily routine. Here are some signs to look out for that may indicate your fuel pump needs attention: If your engine hesitates or sputters when you're driving at higher speeds, it could be a sign that your fuel pump is struggling to provide a consistent flow of fuel to the engine. This can result in uneven acceleration and potential safety hazards. A failing fuel pump may struggle to keep up with the demands of your engine, especially during acceleration or when climbing hills. You might experience a noticeable loss of power or sluggishness when you press the accelerator. Conversely, your fuel pump might deliver intermittent surges of fuel to the engine, causing sudden bursts of acceleration or jerking motions. This inconsistency can make driving unpredictable and dangerous. If your car struggles to start or requires multiple attempts before it finally turns over, the fuel pump could be to blame. A weakened fuel pump may not be able to maintain adequate pressure to start the engine reliably. A failing fuel pump can lead to engine stalling, particularly when idling or driving at low speeds. This can leave you stranded and in need of immediate assistance. You might hear a whining or humming noise coming from the rear of your vehicle, near the fuel tank. This noise could indicate that the fuel pump is straining to operate properly. At Mechanic on the Go, we specialise in diagnosing and repairing issues related to your vehicle's fuel system, including the fuel pump. Our team of experienced technicians is equipped with the knowledge and tools necessary to accurately assess the condition of your fuel pump and recommend the best course of action.

    "content": "Home / Blog/ Car Tips / How Do I Know if My Car’s Cooling System is Functioning Properly? Author Published Wed Aug 07 2024 0 comment(s) How Do I Know if My Car’s Cooling System is Functioning Properly? As car owners, we rely on our vehicles every day to get us where we need to go safely and reliably. One of the critical components that ensures our cars run smoothly is the cooling system. Responsible for regulating the engine temperature, the cooling system is essential for preventing overheating and maintaining optimal performance. 1. Temperature Gauge: Keep an eye on your car’s temperature gauge. Under normal conditions, it should remain steady in the middle of the gauge. If it starts creeping into the red zone or fluctuating unexpectedly, it could indicate a cooling system problem. 2. Coolant Levels: Check your coolant levels regularly. The coolant reservoir typically has markings indicating the minimum and maximum levels. Ensure the coolant is between these marks when the engine is cool. 3. Coolant Colour and Condition: Healthy coolant is usually bright-coloured (green, orange, pink, etc.) and free of debris. If you notice discoloration, particles, or rust in the coolant, it may be time for a flush and replacement. 4. Visible Leaks: Look under your car for any signs of coolant leaks. Puddles of coolant under the vehicle or around the radiator or hoses can indicate a leak that needs immediate attention. 5. Steam or Smoke: If you see steam or smoke coming from under the hood, it could indicate overheating. Pull over safely, turn off the engine, and wait for it to cool down before inspecting further. At Mechanic on the Go, we understand the importance of a reliable cooling system. Our team of expert mechanics specialises in diagnosing and repairing cooling system issues efficiently and effectively. Here’s why you can trust us with your car’s cooling system: 1.

    "title": "How Do I Maintain My Car’s Battery?",
    "content": "Home / Blog/ Car Tips / How Do I Maintain My Car’s Battery? Author Published Wed Aug 07 2024 0 comment(s) At Mechanic on the Go, we understand how vital a well-maintained car battery is to your vehicle’s performance and reliability. A healthy battery ensures your car starts smoothly, electronics run efficiently, and you avoid inconvenient breakdowns. Here’s a comprehensive guide on how to maintain your car’s battery to keep it in top condition. One of the simplest ways to maintain your car battery is through regular inspections. Check the battery terminals for corrosion (a white, ashy substance) and ensure that the connections are tight. Corrosion can be cleaned with a mixture of baking soda and water, but if you’re unsure, our experts at Mechanic on the Go are always here to help. Dirt and grime can conduct electricity, which could potentially drain your battery’s power. Regularly cleaning your battery with a damp cloth can prevent dirt from accumulating. Avoid using excessive water, as it can cause rust or other damage. If your car sits idle for extended periods, the battery can lose charge and eventually die. Driving your car regularly, even for short trips, helps keep the battery charged. If you don’t drive your car often, consider using a trickle charger to maintain the battery’s charge. Frequent short trips can prevent your battery from fully charging. Aim to drive for at least 20 minutes to allow the alternator to recharge the battery fully. Combining errands into one longer trip can help keep your battery in good shape. Turn off all lights, the radio, and other electronics when the engine is not running to avoid draining the battery. Modern cars have features that automatically turn off lights, but it’s always good to double-check before leaving your vehicle. A fully charged car battery should read around 12.6 volts or more. You can check the voltage with a multi-meter. If the reading is below 12.4 volts, your battery may need charging or replacement. If you’re not comfortable checking this yourself, bring your car to Mechanic on the Go, and we’ll be happy to do it for you. Both extreme heat and cold can affect your battery’s performance. During hot summers, park in the shade or garage to avoid overheating. In cold winters, keeping your car in a garage can prevent the battery from freezing. If you live in an area with severe temperatures, consider a battery blanket for extra protection. A loose battery can vibrate, potentially leading to damage and short circuits. Make sure your battery is securely fastened in its tray. If you notice any issues with the battery's placement, our team at Mechanic on the Go can quickly secure it for you. Car batteries typically last 3 to 5 years. If your battery is nearing the end of its lifespan, it’s wise to replace it before it fails completely. Regular maintenance checks can help identify when it’s time for a new battery. Maintaining your car’s battery is essential for reliable performance and avoiding unexpected breakdowns. At Mechanic on the Go, we offer comprehensive battery checks, cleaning, and replacement services to ensure your vehicle runs smoothly. Our experienced technicians are dedicated to providing top-notch service and keeping you on the road with confidence. If you have any concerns about your car’s battery or need a professional inspection, don’t hesitate to contact us.

    "content": "Home / Blog/ Car Tips / Understanding Brake Fluid Maintenance: Your Car's Safety Depends on It Author Published Tue Aug 06 2024 0 comment(s) Understanding Brake Fluid Maintenance: Your Car's Safety Depends on It At Mechanic on the Go, we understand the importance of keeping your vehicle in peak condition. As your trusted auto repair specialists, we often get asked, \"How often should I change my brake fluid?\" It's a critical question that directly impacts your safety on the road. Let's dive into why brake fluid maintenance matters and what you need to know. Why Brake Fluid Matters Brake fluid is often overlooked but plays a vital role in your car's braking system. It transfers the force from your foot on the brake pedal to the actual brakes at each wheel. Over time, brake fluid can absorb moisture from the air, which lowers its boiling point and compromises its effectiveness. This moisture can also lead to corrosion within the braking system, potentially causing costly damage. When Should You Change Your Brake Fluid? Manufacturers typically recommend changing brake fluid every 2 years or 30,000 miles, whichever comes first. However, this can vary depending on your driving habits and the climate you live in. If you frequently drive in stop-and-go traffic or live in a humid area, your brake fluid may degrade faster. Signs That Your Brake Fluid Needs Attention Trust Mechanic on the Go for Your Brake Fluid Needs When it's time for brake fluid maintenance, trust Mechanic on the Go to handle it professionally. Our certified technicians use high-quality brake fluids and follow manufacturer guidelines to ensure your safety and peace of mind.

    "title": "Signs of Worn-Out Shocks or Struts",
    "content": "Home / Blog/ Car Tips / Signs of Worn-Out Shocks or Struts Author Published Tue Aug 06 2024 0 comment(s) As a responsible car owner, you understand the importance of keeping your vehicle in top condition. One crucial aspect often overlooked is the health of your shocks and struts. These components play a vital role in your car’s stability, handling, and overall safety. Recognising the signs of worn-out shocks or struts can save you from potential headaches and ensure a smoother driving experience. 1. Bumpy Ride: Have you noticed your car bouncing excessively over bumps or dips in the road? This is often one of the earliest signs that your shocks or struts are wearing out. Normally, these components absorb the impact of uneven surfaces, providing a comfortable ride. When they start to fail, you'll feel every imperfection on the road. 2. Nose Dives and Rear Squats: Pay attention to how your car behaves when you brake or accelerate. If you experience noticeable forward dips (nose dives) when braking or rear-end squats when accelerating, it could indicate worn-out shocks or struts. These parts help to maintain your car's posture during such maneuvers, and their deterioration can affect both comfort and safety. 3. Uneven Tire Wear: Keep an eye on your tires. Excessive or uneven tire wear can be a sign of various issues, including misaligned wheels or worn-out shocks and struts. When these components are no longer effectively absorbing shocks, your tires bear more of the impact, leading to premature wear and potentially compromising your safety on the road. 4. Steering Responsiveness: Are you noticing increased difficulty in steering or a feeling of instability while driving? Worn-out shocks or struts can affect how your car responds to steering inputs, making it feel less stable and controlled. This can be particularly noticeable when taking corners or navigating tight turns. 5. Fluid Leaks or Visible Damage: Take a peek under your car. Any signs of fluid leaks around the shock or strut assemblies should be investigated promptly. Leakage indicates internal wear and can lead to further damage if left unchecked. Additionally, visible physical damage to these components, such as dents or rust, is a clear indication that they may need attention. Why Choose Mechanic on the Go? At Mechanic on the Go, we understand the importance of reliable and trustworthy auto repair services. Our team of experienced professionals is dedicated to ensuring your vehicle performs at its best, starting with a thorough inspection of your shocks and struts.

    "content": "Home / Blog/ Car Tips / How Can I Improve My Car’s Fuel Efficiency? Author Published Fri Aug 02 2024 0 comment(s) In today’s world, fuel efficiency isn’t just about saving money—it’s about being kind to the environment too. At Mechanic on the Go, we understand that every mile per gallon counts, and we’re here to help you get the most out of every drop of fuel. Here are some practical tips to improve your car’s fuel efficiency and why choosing us for your auto maintenance needs can make all the difference. A well-maintained engine runs more efficiently. Regular oil changes, timely replacement of air filters, and ensuring your spark plugs are in good condition can significantly improve fuel efficiency. At Mechanic on the Go, our experts perform thorough engine checks and maintenance to keep your vehicle running smoothly. Under-inflated tires can decrease fuel efficiency by up to 3%. Regularly checking and maintaining the correct tire pressure can not only save fuel but also extend the life of your tires. Our mobile service can come to you and ensure your tires are always at their optimal pressure. Carrying excess weight in your car can reduce fuel efficiency. Clear out unnecessary items from your trunk and back seat. If you need help with larger items or vehicle modifications, our team is ready to assist you with practical solutions. Aggressive driving, such as rapid acceleration and braking, can lower your gas mileage by 15-30% on highways and 10-40% in city driving. Our driving tips and training sessions can help you adopt a smoother driving style, ultimately saving you money at the pump. When driving on highways, using cruise control can help maintain a constant speed and, in turn, save fuel. If your cruise control isn’t working correctly, our technicians can diagnose and fix the issue quickly. Idling for long periods can waste a significant amount of fuel. If you’re waiting for more than a minute, it’s more efficient to turn off your engine. We can help ensure your vehicle starts reliably every time, making it easier to follow this tip. Combine errands into one trip and plan your routes to avoid traffic and unnecessary backtracking. Efficient trip planning can reduce the distance you drive and improve your overall fuel economy. Using the manufacturer’s recommended grade of motor oil can improve fuel efficiency by 1-2%.

    "title": "Why Your Gearbox Should Be Replaced, Not Repaired",
    "content": "Home / Blog/ Car Tips / Why Your Gearbox Should Be Replaced, Not Repaired Author Published Thu Aug 01 2024 0 comment(s) As a car owner, you know the importance of keeping your vehicle in top condition. Regular maintenance and timely repairs can keep your car running smoothly and safely. One critical component that often gets overlooked until it causes significant issues is the gearbox. At Mechanic on the Go, we believe in providing you with the best possible service, which is why we recommend replacing, rather than repairing, your gearbox when problems arise. Here’s why: When your gearbox starts malfunctioning, it’s often a sign of significant wear and tear. Repairing the gearbox might offer a temporary fix, but it doesn’t address the root cause of the problem. By opting for a replacement, you ensure that all the internal components are brand new and functioning correctly, providing long-term reliability and peace of mind. A repaired gearbox is more likely to experience recurring issues. Since only the faulty parts are replaced, other worn-out components may soon fail, leading to further repairs and expenses. Replacing the entire gearbox eliminates the risk of such issues, ensuring your car operates smoothly without frequent breakdowns. A new gearbox can significantly improve your vehicle’s performance. Over time, worn-out gears and components can reduce efficiency, affecting acceleration and fuel economy. By replacing the gearbox, you restore your car’s original performance levels, making your driving experience more enjoyable and efficient. While repairing a gearbox might seem like a cost-effective solution in the short term, it can end up costing you more in the long run. Frequent repairs and the potential for further damage can add up quickly. Replacing the gearbox is a more cost-effective solution over time, saving you money on repeated repairs and associated inconveniences. Many car manufacturers recommend replacing the gearbox rather than repairing it, especially for newer models. This recommendation is based on the understanding that modern gearboxes are complex systems, and a full replacement is often more reliable than attempting to repair individual components. When you opt for a gearbox replacement, you often receive a warranty or guarantee on the new part. This provides added assurance that any future issues will be covered, offering you extra protection and value. Repairs, on the other hand, may not come with the same level of warranty, leaving you vulnerable to further costs. A malfunctioning gearbox can pose serious safety risks. Sudden gear failures or unpredictable behaviour can lead to dangerous situations on the road. Replacing the gearbox ensures that your vehicle remains safe to drive, protecting you, your passengers, and other road users. At Mechanic on the Go, we understand the importance of reliable, safe, and cost-effective solutions for your vehicle. Our experienced technicians are committed to providing top-quality service and ensuring your car is in optimal condition. By choosing us for your gearbox replacement, you’re making a wise investment in your vehicle’s longevity and performance. Don’t wait for minor gearbox issues to turn into major problems. Contact Mechanic on the Go today to schedule your gearbox replacement and experience the difference in your car’s performance and reliability. Trust us to keep you on the road, worry-free.

    "content": "Home / Blog/ Car Tips / How Do I Know When My Car Needs an Oil Change? Author Published Thu Aug 01 2024 0 comment(s) How Do I Know When My Car Needs an Oil Change? As a car owner, keeping your vehicle in top shape is essential for ensuring its longevity and performance. One of the most critical maintenance tasks is changing your car’s oil regularly. But how do you know when it’s time for an oil change? At Mechanic on the Go, we want to help you understand the signs that indicate your car needs fresh oil. Before we dive into the signs, let’s talk about why oil changes are so important. Oil is the lifeblood of your engine. It lubricates moving parts, reduces friction, helps keep the engine cool, and prevents dirt and debris from causing damage. Over time, oil breaks down and becomes less effective, which can lead to increased wear and tear on your engine. Modern cars are equipped with sensors that monitor the condition of your oil. If your dashboard’s oil change light comes on, it’s a clear sign that your car needs an oil change. The check engine light can also indicate low oil levels, which can cause engine damage if not addressed promptly. Fresh oil provides a protective layer between engine parts. When the oil becomes old and dirty, it loses its lubricating properties, leading to increased friction. This can cause your engine to make unusual noises, such as knocking or rumbling. You can check the condition of your oil by pulling out the dipstick and wiping it with a clean cloth. Fresh oil is typically amber and translucent. Over time, it turns dark and dirty as it collects particles and debris. If your oil looks thick and grimy, it’s time for a change. If you smell oil inside your car, it could mean there’s a leak or that the oil is burning due to overheating. Both situations require immediate attention. An oil leak can lead to a drop in oil levels, while burning oil can cause engine damage. While a small amount of translucent vapor from the exhaust is normal, blue or gray smoke is not. This could indicate that oil is leaking into the engine or the exhaust system. If you notice smoke, it’s essential to get your car checked right away. Most car manufacturers recommend changing the oil every 3,000 to 5,000 miles, but this can vary based on your vehicle and driving habits. Check your owner’s manual for the recommended oil change interval. If you’ve driven more miles than suggested, it’s time for an oil change. At Mechanic on the Go, we understand that maintaining your car can sometimes feel overwhelming. That’s why we’re here to make it easy for you. Our team of skilled mechanics is ready to come to your location and provide top-notch service, whether you need an oil change or any other maintenance. Don’t wait for the signs to become problems.

    "content": "Home / Blog/ Car Tips / Guide to Finding Reliable Car Mechanics in Nigerian Cities Author Published Thu Jul 25 2024 1 comment(s) Owning a car comes with its joys and responsibilities. One of the most crucial aspects of car ownership is finding a reliable mechanic who can keep your vehicle running smoothly. Whether you're in Lagos or any other Nigerian city, knowing how to choose the right mechanic can save you time, money, and ensure your safety on the road. Start your search by asking friends, family, and colleagues for recommendations. Personal referrals are often the best way to find a trustworthy mechanic. People are usually happy to share their positive experiences with mechanics who have provided excellent service. In this digital age, online reviews can provide valuable insights into a mechanic's reputation. Websites like Google Reviews, Facebook, and specialised review platforms can give you an idea of what other customers think about a particular auto repair shop. Look for consistently high ratings and positive comments about customer service, pricing, and quality of work. Ensure that the mechanics and technicians at the repair shop are properly trained and certified. Look for certifications from reputable organisations such as the Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) or manufacturer-specific certifications. Experience in handling your car make and model is also a plus. Take a trip to the mechanic's shop before committing to any service. Pay attention to the cleanliness and organisation of the facility. A well-maintained shop often reflects attention to detail and professionalism. Additionally, observe how the staff interacts with customers and whether they are willing to answer your questions. A reputable mechanic will often provide warranties or guarantees on their work. Inquire about the specific terms of these guarantees and what they cover. This demonstrates the mechanic's confidence in their abilities and commitment to customer satisfaction. Before agreeing to any repairs, obtain estimates from multiple mechanics. This allows you to compare prices and services offered. Be wary of significantly lower prices as they may indicate substandard parts or workmanship. Ultimately, trust your instincts when choosing a mechanic. If something doesn’t feel right or if you’re not comfortable with the explanations provided, consider seeking a second opinion. A good mechanic will prioritise transparency and ensure you fully understand the repairs needed. Finding a reliable car mechanic in Nigerian cities like Lagos doesn’t have to be daunting. By following these steps—seeking recommendations, checking reviews, verifying credentials, visiting the shop, asking about warranties, getting estimates, and trusting your instincts—you can make an informed decision. At Mechanic on the Go, we prioritise transparency, quality service, and customer satisfaction. Trust us with your car care needs, and we’ll ensure your vehicle stays in optimal condition on Nigeria’s roads. Ready to experience hassle-free car maintenance? Contact Mechanic on the Go today!

    "content": "Home / Blog/ Car Tips / How to Prevent Overheating in Nigerian Traffic Author Published Wed Jul 17 2024 0 comment(s) Driving in Nigerian traffic, especially during the hot seasons, can put a strain on your vehicle, often leading to overheating issues if not managed properly. At Mechanic on the Go, we understand the challenges Nigerian drivers face, and we're here to help you keep your car running smoothly even in the toughest conditions. Here are some essential tips to prevent overheating and ensure your vehicle stays in top shape: Regular maintenance is key to preventing overheating. Make sure to schedule routine checks for your cooling system, including radiator, coolant levels, hoses, and fans. Our expert mechanics can perform thorough inspections to identify any potential issues before they become serious problems. Coolant is vital for regulating your engine's temperature. Ensure that your coolant levels are always topped up to the manufacturer's specifications. If you're unsure about how to check or refill coolant, our team is here to assist you. Belts and hoses can wear out over time, leading to coolant leaks or inefficient cooling system operation. Regularly inspect these components and replace them as needed to prevent unexpected breakdowns. Pay attention to your vehicle's temperature gauge while driving. If you notice it creeping into the red zone or your dashboard warning light comes on, it's a sign of potential overheating. Pull over safely, turn off your engine, and let it cool down before continuing. If possible, plan your routes to avoid heavy traffic congestion, especially during peak hours and in areas prone to gridlock. Stop-and-go traffic can significantly increase your engine's temperature, so keeping moving whenever possible can help prevent overheating. While air conditioning provides comfort, it also puts an additional load on your engine. Use it judiciously, especially in stop-and-go traffic, to reduce strain on your cooling system. Engine oil plays a crucial role in lubricating and cooling your engine. Ensure that your oil levels are adequate and that you follow the manufacturer's recommendations for oil changes to maintain optimal engine performance. Preventive maintenance is the best way to avoid overheating issues. Schedule regular service appointments with Mechanic on the Go to keep your vehicle in peak condition. Our skilled technicians will ensure that your cooling system and other vital components are functioning correctly. At Mechanic on the Go, we're committed to providing reliable automotive services tailored to the unique demands of Nigerian drivers.

    "content": "Home / Blog/ Car Tips / How to Maintain Your Car in Nigeria's Climate Author Published Wed Jul 17 2024 0 comment(s) How to Maintain Your Car in Nigeria's Climate Living in Nigeria means experiencing a diverse range of weather conditions, from the scorching heat of the dry season to the heavy rains of the wet season. These varying conditions can take a toll on your vehicle, making proper maintenance crucial to keep your car running smoothly. At Mechanic on the Go, we understand the unique challenges Nigerian drivers face and are here to help you navigate them. Here’s a comprehensive guide on how to maintain your car in Nigeria’s climate. Nigeria’s climate can cause your engine oil to break down faster than in more temperate regions. Regular oil changes are essential to keep your engine lubricated and running efficiently. We recommend checking your oil levels frequently and changing your oil every 5,000 kilometres or as specified by your vehicle’s manufacturer. The intense heat can lead to your engine overheating if your cooling system is not in top shape. Ensure that your radiator is functioning correctly and that the coolant levels are adequate. Regularly check for leaks in the radiator and hoses, and consider flushing the cooling system every two years to remove any buildup that could impede its performance. Nigeria’s rough and varied road conditions can wear out your tires quickly. Regularly check your tire pressure and ensure it is at the recommended level. Rotate your tires every 10,000 kilometres to promote even wear, and keep an eye out for any signs of damage or excessive wear. Adequate tire maintenance will not only improve your vehicle’s performance but also enhance your safety on the road. The combination of high temperatures and humidity can shorten your car battery’s lifespan. Regularly inspect your battery for corrosion on the terminals and clean them as needed. Ensure the battery is securely mounted and check the fluid levels if applicable. If your battery is more than three years old, consider having it tested to avoid unexpected failures. Driving in Nigeria often involves navigating through traffic and dealing with sudden stops. This makes it crucial to keep your brake system in excellent condition. Regularly check your brake pads for wear and tear, and have them replaced when necessary. Additionally, ensure that the brake fluid is at the proper level and free from contamination. The intense sun and heavy rains can damage your car’s paint and exterior. Regular washing and waxing can help protect your vehicle’s finish from the elements. Consider parking in shaded areas or using a car cover to shield your car from the sun’s UV rays and reduce the risk of paint fading and cracking. A functioning air conditioning system is a must in Nigeria’s hot climate. Regularly check the refrigerant levels and have the system inspected for any leaks or issues. Keeping your air conditioning system in good shape will not only keep you comfortable but also prevent any potential damage to the system components. The heavy rains during the wet season can severely impact your visibility while driving. Ensure your windshield wipers are in good condition and replace them if they show signs of wear. Additionally, keep your washer fluid topped up to help clear any dirt or debris that accumulates on your windshield. Nigeria’s roads can be quite challenging, putting a strain on your vehicle’s suspension system. Regularly inspect your shock absorbers, struts, and other suspension components for any signs of wear or damage. Addressing any issues promptly will ensure a smoother and safer ride. Finally, regular inspections by a professional mechanic are essential to catch any potential issues before they become major problems. At Mechanic on the Go, we offer comprehensive inspection services tailored to the specific needs of Nigerian drivers. Our experienced technicians will ensure your car is in top condition, giving you peace of mind on the road. Maintaining your car in Nigeria’s climate requires a proactive approach and attention to detail. By following these tips and relying on the expertise of Mechanic on the Go, you can keep your vehicle running smoothly and efficiently, no matter the weather conditions. Schedule your next maintenance appointment with us today and experience the difference of professional, reliable service.

Verify the authenticity of the parts you purchase to ensure they meet industry standards and are compatible with your vehicle. Look for manufacturer labels, serial numbers, and warranties as indicators of authenticity. Always inquire about warranty coverage before purchasing any spare parts.

    "content": "Home / Blog/ Car Tips / The Ultimate Guide to Buying a Used Car in Nigeria Author Published Wed Jul 17 2024 0 comment(s) Buying a used car can be an exciting yet daunting experience, especially in Nigeria, where the market is diverse and sometimes unpredictable. At Mechanic on the Go, we understand the challenges car buyers face and are here to provide you with the ultimate guide to help you make an informed and confident decision. Our goal is to gain your trust and make sure you come to us for any issues or questions you may have during your car-buying journey. Before you start searching for a used car, it’s crucial to set a realistic budget. Consider not only the purchase price but also additional costs such as insurance, registration, and potential repairs. Knowing your budget will help you narrow down your options and prevent you from overspending. Familiarize yourself with the types of cars available in the Nigerian market. Popular choices include Toyota, Honda, and Hyundai due to their reliability and availability of spare parts. Use online platforms, visit car dealerships, and attend car fairs to gather information about different makes and models. Once you’ve found a potential car, it’s essential to check its history. Verify the car’s registration documents, service records, and previous ownership. Be cautious of cars with a history of accidents or major repairs. Websites like AutoCheck Nigeria can provide you with detailed vehicle history reports. A thorough inspection is crucial to avoid future problems. Here’s a checklist to guide you: At Mechanic on the Go, we offer pre-purchase inspections to give you peace of mind. Our expert mechanics will thoroughly inspect the car and provide you with a detailed report. Low mileage is generally preferable, but be wary of cars with unusually low mileage for their age, as the odometer may have been tampered with. Compare the mileage with the car’s service records to ensure consistency. Don’t be afraid to negotiate the price. Use the information you’ve gathered from your research and inspection to justify your offer. Be prepared to walk away if the seller isn’t willing to meet a reasonable price. Make sure all necessary paperwork is in order before finalizing the purchase. This includes the bill of sale, transfer of ownership, and any warranty documents. It’s advisable to have a trusted mechanic or legal expert review the documents to ensure everything is legitimate. Once you’ve purchased the car, arrange for insurance immediately. Compare quotes from different insurance companies to find the best coverage for your needs. Comprehensive insurance is recommended to protect you from potential risks. Regular maintenance is key to keeping your used car in good condition. At Mechanic on the Go, we offer a range of services, including oil changes, brake inspections, and tire rotations, to ensure your car runs smoothly.

    "title": "Must-Have Accessories for Nigerian Car Owners",
    "content": "Home / Blog/ Car Tips / Must-Have Accessories for Nigerian Car Owners Author Published Wed Jul 17 2024 0 comment(s) Owning a car in Nigeria is both a convenience and a necessity. However, to ensure a smooth driving experience and to be prepared for any unexpected situations, equipping your car with the right accessories is essential. At Mechanic on the Go, we understand the unique challenges Nigerian drivers face and are here to provide you with a list of must-have accessories that can enhance your driving experience and safety on the road. A dashboard camera, or dash cam, is an invaluable tool for Nigerian drivers. It records everything that happens on the road, providing crucial evidence in case of accidents or disputes. A dash cam can also help you monitor the behaviour of your driver if you have one, ensuring they adhere to safe driving practices. A well-stocked first aid kit is a necessity for every car owner. In the event of minor accidents or injuries, having immediate access to medical supplies can make a significant difference. Ensure your kit includes bandages, antiseptic wipes, pain relievers, and other essential items. Road conditions in Nigeria can be unpredictable, making a flat tire a common occurrence. Always have a spare tire, jack, and lug wrench in your car. Knowing how to change a tire can save you from being stranded in inconvenient or unsafe locations. A dead battery can happen to anyone, especially in Nigeria’s hot climate, which can drain car batteries faster. Jumper cables are a must-have to get your car running again. They allow you to jump-start your car using another vehicle’s battery, saving you time and money. Maintaining the correct tire pressure is crucial for safe driving and fuel efficiency. A portable tire inflator lets you inflate your tires on the go, ensuring you’re never stuck with a flat tire. This is particularly useful for long road trips or when driving through areas with few service stations. Car fires, though rare, can happen and are extremely dangerous. A compact fire extinguisher designed for automotive use can help you quickly address small fires before they become uncontrollable. Regularly check that your extinguisher is fully charged and easily accessible. An emergency roadside kit can be a lifesaver in case of a breakdown. It typically includes reflective triangles, a flashlight, batteries, a multi-tool, and other essentials. These items can help you stay safe and visible while waiting for assistance. Using your phone while driving is dangerous and illegal in many places, including Nigeria. A phone mount allows you to keep your hands on the wheel while using your phone for navigation. It also helps keep your phone secure and within easy reach. Protecting your car’s interior from dirt, spills, and wear is important, especially if you frequently drive on dusty or muddy roads. Quality seat covers and floor mats can keep your car looking new and make cleaning much easier. Nigeria’s air quality can vary greatly, especially in urban areas with heavy traffic. A car air purifier helps to keep the air inside your car clean and free from pollutants, allergens, and unpleasant odours, providing a healthier driving environment. At Mechanic on the Go, we not only provide top-notch repair services but also offer expert advice to keep your car in optimal condition.

    "content": "Home / Blog/ Car Tips / Essential Car Maintenance Checklist for Nigerian Drivers Author Published Wed Jul 17 2024 0 comment(s) Keeping your car in top shape is essential, especially with the unique driving conditions in Nigeria. Whether navigating the bustling streets of Lagos or the rugged roads of the countryside, regular maintenance is key to ensuring your vehicle's longevity and your safety. At Mechanic on the Go, we're dedicated to providing top-notch auto repair services to keep you on the road. Here’s an essential car maintenance checklist tailored for Nigerian drivers to help you stay on top of your vehicle’s needs. Changing your car’s oil regularly is crucial. It keeps your engine running smoothly and efficiently. Check your owner's manual for the recommended oil change interval, but typically, it's every 5,000 to 7,500 kilometres. Using high-quality oil is essential, especially in the hot and dusty conditions common in Nigeria. The air filter prevents dust and debris from entering your engine. Given Nigeria's dusty environment, it’s important to check and replace your air filter more frequently. A clogged air filter can reduce engine performance and fuel efficiency. Regularly check all your car’s fluids, including brake fluid, transmission fluid, power steering fluid, coolant, and windshield washer fluid. Ensuring these are at the correct levels can prevent major issues and keep your car running smoothly. Your brakes are crucial for your safety. Regularly inspect brake pads, rotors, and brake fluid. If you notice any squeaking or reduced braking performance, it’s time to visit Mechanic on the Go for a professional check-up. Properly inflated and maintained tires are vital. Check your tire pressure monthly and ensure they’re inflated to the manufacturer’s recommended levels. Also, look out for tread wear and rotate your tires every 10,000 kilometres to ensure even wear. The battery is the heart of your car’s electrical system. Extreme temperatures can affect its performance. Regularly check for corrosion on the terminals and ensure it holds a charge. If your car struggles to start, it may be time for a new battery. Ensure all your lights, including headlights, brake lights, and indicators, are functioning correctly. Regularly inspect your vehicle’s electrical system to avoid issues with starting your car or other electrical functions. Nigeria's roads can be tough on your car’s suspension and steering systems. Regularly check for any unusual noises or vibrations and ensure your steering is responsive. If you notice any issues, visit Mechanic on the Go for a thorough inspection. Your car’s cooling system prevents the engine from overheating. Regularly check the coolant level and inspect hoses and the radiator for any signs of leaks or damage. Flushing the coolant system as per the manufacturer’s recommendation is also essential. Even with regular DIY checks, it’s important to have your car inspected by a professional mechanic periodically. At Mechanic on the Go, our experts can identify potential issues before they become major problems, ensuring your vehicle stays in peak condition. Staying on top of these maintenance tasks can save you from unexpected breakdowns and expensive repairs. At Mechanic on the Go, we’re here to assist with all your auto repair and maintenance needs.

As a car owner you must be very careful to ensure that you detect and prevent oil leaks in order to avoid bigger issues that may occur as a result of the leaks. In this post, we’ll be looking at steps to prevent and detect oil leaks. Regular Inspections: Ensure you check constantly for possible leakage. It starts with little negligible drops, then slowly but surely, it would become more visible and your car would be leaving trails. Check Oil Levels: Monitor your oil levels between changes. A sudden drop in oil level may indicate a leak. Address Gasket and Seal Maintenance: Gaskets and seals can deteriorate over time, leading to leaks. Ensure they are well-maintained during routine servicing. Read more about gaskets here. Use High-Quality Oil: Quality engine oil and regular oil changes can reduce the risk of oil leaks. Read more on engine oil viscosity here. Engine Health: Identifying and fixing oil leaks can prevent engine damage and costly repairs as your engine needs a healthy supply of oil to carry out several tasks. Cost Savings: Timely detection and repair of oil leakage can save you from premature spending on oil and engine repair. Safety: Preventing oil leaks ensures your car operates smoothly, reducing the risk of accidents due to engine issues. In conclusion, it is very important for car owners to check and ensure there is no oil leak because detecting oil leaks early can help you address potential issues before they escalate into costly repairs.

    "content": "Home / Blog/ Car Tips / How to Solve The Problem of A Shaky Steering Wheel: Including Potential Causes Author Published Thu Nov 02 2023 1 comment(s) A shaky steering wheel is not just an annoyance; it's a clear sign that something may be amiss with your car. We’ll be looking at the possible causes and of course, the possible solutions to this issue. At the end of this brief post, you will be well-equipped to discern steering wheel issues and know how to solve them. It is an indicator: A shaky or vibrating steering wheel is often an early indicator of underlying issues with your vehicle's components or alignment. From your steering wheel you can easily tell when your car is not feeling fine. Safety Implications: If you cannot control your steering wheel properly, then you also cannot control your car properly. Don't play. Wheel Imbalance: Unevenly distributed weight on your wheels can lead to wheel imbalance, resulting in vibrations through the steering wheel. Like we’ve agreed earlier, there are certain problems in your car that you can feel through your steering wheel. One of them is wheel imbalance. Tire Issues: Damaged or improperly inflated tires can cause steering wheel vibrations, affecting your car's handling and safety. To avoid this, we have a blogpost specially on tires just for you here. Wheel Misalignment: Poorly aligned wheels can create steering wheel shake, impacting tire wear and overall vehicle performance. We advise our customers to have their tires re-aligned properly 5000-6000 Kilometers and every time you buy a new set of tires. Brake Problems: Brake issues, such as warped rotors, can induce vibrations when you apply the brakes. Your brakes are very crucial for your safety. Hence, if your steering wheel is shaky, it is definitely a safety hazard. Wheel Alignment and Balancing: Have your wheels balanced to ensure even weight distribution, eliminating vibrations caused by wheel imbalance. As said earlier, every 5-6k Kilometers.

    "content": "Home / Blog/ Maintenance / The Importance of Tire Maintenance Author Published Tue Oct 31 2023 2 comment(s) Tire maintenance is a fundamental aspect of car ownership that often goes overlooked. Your tires are the only part of your car making direct contact with the road, or at least they’re supposed to be the only part👀. If they are not maintained properly, they put you at risk of not being able to move the car at all and also at risk of having accidents. Safety: Ensuring that your tires are maintained properly, is vital to your safety.

Proper Inflation: Maintain the recommended tire pressure as specified by your vehicle's manufacturer to ensure even wear and safe handling. Tire Rotation: Tire rotation involves moving the tires at the back to the front, and vice-versa. Regularly rotate your tires to promote even tread wear and extend their lifespan.

    "content": "Home / Blog/ Maintenance / What is the use of My Car’s Oil Filter? Author Published Thu Oct 19 2023 0 comment(s) Your car's oil filter might seem like a negligible part of the car but don’t be deceived, it’s very very important in the day-to-day running of your car. In this post, we take a deep dive into this important part! Engine Protection: The oil filter is a guardian of your car's engine, responsible for trapping contaminants and debris that can harm critical engine components. It’s like a sieve, harmful things stay away, good things keep flowing! Clean Oil Circulation: It ensures a continuous flow of clean oil and this clean oil is vital for lubricating engine parts and reducing friction. How Does the Oil Filter Work? Filtration: As engine oil circulates through the filter, it passes through a porous medium designed to capture particles like dirt, debris, and metal fragments. Cleansing: The filter holds these contaminants, preventing them from circulating through the engine and causing wear and damage. There are so many vital reasons to take good care of your oil filter, here are two major reasons: Dusty Conditions: In a country like Nigeria especially, climate and road conditions can lead to increased dust and debris on the roads, making a reliable oil filter crucial to maintaining engine health. As we would say in Nigeria, “They no dey tell person!” Traffic Congestion: Frequent stop-and-go traffic, especially in urban areas, can put extra stress on engines. A clean oil filter ensures that your engine receives optimal lubrication. Regular Replacement: At Mechanic On The Go, our essential and comprehensive services include proper check and replacement of Oil filters. We understand the importance of this! Quality Matters: Choose a high-quality oil filter to guarantee optimal filtration and protection for your engine. Once again, at MOTG we ensure that we use only the best and you can reachout to us for help with this! Frequent Inspections: Periodically inspect your oil filter for signs of clogging or damage. Early detection can prevent engine problems. In summary, the oil filter is a small but vital component for your car's engine health. Don't let contaminants and debris compromise your engine's performance and longevity. Oil filter issues or car issues in general?

Author Published Thu Oct 12 2023 0 comment(s) Spark plugs have two major purposes in a car; Igniting Combustion: Spark plugs are a key feature in igniting the air-fuel mixture within the engine's cylinders. This controlled ignition generates the power needed to move your car. AND Fuel Efficiency: Fuel prices seem to be increasing nearly everyday. However, with properly functioning spark plugs, you can ensure efficient combustion in your car, leading to better fuel economy and reduced emissions. Again, small but mighty! Copper Spark Plugs: Affordable and effective, these spark plugs offer good conductivity but have a shorter lifespan compared to other types. Iridium Spark Plugs: Known for their longevity and consistent performance, iridium spark plugs are a popular choice for modern engines. Platinum Spark Plugs: Platinum plugs strike a balance between performance and durability, making them a reliable option for many vehicles. You should definitely contact a trusted mechanic, particularly at Mechanic On The Go to get more info on these. Rough Idling: Idling simply means your car engine is turned on but your car is not in motion. If your car idles roughly or shakes, it could be due to worn spark plugs. Reduced Fuel Efficiency: As said earlier, spark plugs contribute to your car’s fuel efficiency so if you notice your car being less-efficient than normal, you should get them checked. Misfiring: Frequent engine misfires, indicated by a jerking sensation or loss of power, may be a sign of spark plug issues. Regular Inspection: Routine checks help identify worn or fouled spark plugs. At Mechanic On The Go we carry out checks on our customers’ spark plugs to ensure they remain in top working condition. Proper Installation: When replacing spark plugs, ensure they are correctly gapped and tightened to the manufacturer's specifications. Quality Matters: Invest in high-quality spark plugs to ensure longevity and optimal performance. Better to spend big at once for quality than to spend peanuts and end up dancing to the tune of incompetent spark plugs. In summary, we hope we’ve been able to convince you and not confuse you that spark plugs are very important to your car(s).

    "title": "Why Do Radiator Fans Fail?",
    "content": "Home / Blog/ Maintenance / Why Do Radiator Fans Fail? Author Published Sat Sep 23 2023 0 comment(s) Radiator fans play a critical role in keeping your car's engine cool and preventing overheating. When these fans fail, it can lead to serious issues. In this guide, we'll explore the common reasons why radiator fans spoil in cars, helping you understand the importance of timely maintenance and repair. Over time, the continuous operation of radiator fans can cause wear and tear on their components. Bearings may deteriorate, causing the fan to wobble or make unusual noises. Regular maintenance can help identify and address this issue early. Faulty wiring, relays, or sensors can disrupt the electrical system responsible for controlling the radiator fan. When this happens, the fan may not turn on when needed, leading to overheating. Electrical diagnostics and repairs are essential to resolve these issues. The electric motor that drives the radiator fan can fail due to various reasons, such as overheating, excessive load, or simply aging. A malfunctioning motor will render the fan inoperative and must be replaced promptly. Dust, debris, and dirt can accumulate on the fan blades and housing, causing imbalance and reduced efficiency. Regular cleaning and maintenance can prevent this issue and ensure optimal fan performance. Coolant leaks can damage the radiator fan assembly, leading to corrosion and failure. Addressing coolant leaks promptly and repairing any resulting damage is crucial to prevent fan failure. Accidental impacts or contact with foreign objects can damage the fan blades, causing them to become misshapen or imbalanced. Inspect your fan blades regularly and replace them if needed. A consistently overheating engine can put excessive stress on the radiator fan, leading to premature failure. Identifying and resolving the root cause of engine overheating is essential to prevent fan damage.

    "content": "Home / Blog/ Car tips / Car Overheating: Causes, Symptoms, and Prevention Tips Author Published Thu Sep 21 2023 0 comment(s) As with several car issues around, car overheating is a common issue that many drivers face. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the causes, symptoms, and prevention tips to help you understand and resolve this frustrating problem. Get ready to have your overheating issues fixed! Car engines operate at a specific temperature range, and when they exceed this range, they can overheat. In simpler terms, if the temperature of a car goes beyond its required range (usually between 75 and 105 degrees celsius), overheating occurs. Several factors can contribute to this issue, and here are four major factors: 1. Coolant Issues: Low coolant levels or a malfunctioning cooling system can lead to overheating. Ensure your coolant levels are adequate and the system is in good working order. 2. Radiator Problems: A clogged or damaged radiator can hinder the cooling process. Regular maintenance and inspection of your radiator are crucial. At Mechanic On The Go (MOTG), our customers are alerted about maintaining their radiators, to ensure top functionality. 3. Faulty Thermostat: A malfunctioning thermostat can prevent your engine from regulating its temperature correctly. 4. Extreme Weather Conditions: High temperatures and humidity can put extra strain on your car's cooling system, especially in a country like Nigeria. Ensure your vehicle is prepared for inevitable hot weather by checking the other three points mentioned above. Recognizing the signs of an overheating car can help you take action before the situation worsens. Common symptoms include: 1. Rising Temperature Gauge: Keep an eye on your car's temperature gauge. If it starts creeping into the red zone, your engine may be overheating. 2. Steam or Smoke: If you see steam or smoke coming from the engine bay, it's a clear indicator of overheating. As we always say at MOTG, “Don’t ignore the days of little beginnings!” 3. Strange Odors: Overheating can produce unusual odors, often described as a sweet, syrupy smell. This could be your coolant leaking. Prevention (which is 100% better than cure) is the best way to avoid the hassle and expense of dealing with an overheated engine. Here are some tips to keep your car running smoothly: 1. Regular Maintenance: Schedule regular check-ups with your mechanic (Mechanic On The Go) to ensure your cooling system is in good condition. 2. Check Coolant Levels: Make sure your coolant levels are topped up and the mixture is appropriate for your climate. 3. Inspect Hoses and Belts: Cracked or damaged hoses and belts can lead to coolant leaks or cooling system failure. 4. Drive Smart: Avoid aggressive driving and heavy traffic whenever possible, as these conditions can strain your engine. 5. Stay Hydrated: Keep an eye on your engine's temperature gauge during very hot weather and take breaks if necessary because a lot times, cars are like humans! In conclusion, car overheating can be a frustrating and potentially costly issue, but with proper maintenance and awareness of the symptoms, you can keep your vehicle running smoothly.

    "title": "Engine Oils and Their Filters",
    "content": "A great deal of research and new technology have advanced the fields of oil lubrication and contamination through oil filters. If you still think (as many do), that “All oil filters do the same thing, so why pay more for a brand name?” then it may be time to reconsider. Lubrication research continues to improve how lubricants (such as oils) protect moving parts, increase fuel economy, and extend the life of your engine. The lubrication industry has continually up­graded the quality of engine crankcase oils, grease (chassis, wheel bearings), transmission fluids, hydraulic fluids, gear oils, and brake fluids. The thought that all oils are the same implies that a piece of equipment built five years ago requires the same lubricants as the same type of equipment being built today. But fuel conservation, lower emissions, new materials, and better manufacturing (tighter equipment tolerances) all combine to require specialized oils and filters for today’s equipment that older models did not have. As lubrication needs have evolved, trucks, planters, harvesters, sprayers, trailers, and engines depend on the proper oil to keep internal parts operating and functioning properly within the equipment specifications. As equipment specifications change, manufacturer’s design and upgrade oil lubricants to meet the new demands. That’s why it is important to identify and select the proper oil and filter based on the equipment manufacturer rather than basing your selection on cost. Performance and compatibility must come first; price should come second. While lubricants and filters may look similar and be packaged alike, remember that it’s what you don’t see inside the product that allows it to perform a certain way. Separating products that perform well from those that do not perform as well can be challenging, be­cause the technical information is conveyed in a coded language consisting of numbers and abbreviations. These numbers and abbreviations are the industry standards that lubricant manufacturers use when they build their products. The purpose of this article is to demystify these numbers and abbreviations so that you will be able to distinguish the differences between oils and oil filters. Understanding these terms will help you choose the best (which is not always the cheapest or even the most expensive) engine oils and oil filters for your equipment and application. In the long run, choosing the correct oil and filter will increase equipment reliability, enhance operating performance, lower maintenance costs, and extend your equipment’s service life. The key to selecting the correct lubricants for your equipment begins and ends with the owner’s manual. Whether you have a half million-dollar piece of agricultural equipment or a 300-dollar engine lawn mower, you should use the lubricants the manufacturer recommends and change or apply them when they specify. It is critical to follow owner’s manual instructions, especially while the equipment is still under warranty. Failing to follow the recommendations can void the warranty. Retailers have shelves filled with multiple brands of engine oils. Each manufacturer claims their product offers one advantage or another over the competitors. Most engine oils, however, are similar in that they are designed to meet basic engine specifications, such as: Conventional engine oils begin life as crude oil pumped from underground reservoirs. Raw crude contains impurities that need to be removed and require further refinement to get the oil to a specific viscosity. Conventional engine oils consist of approximately 80 percent refined crude oil (called base oil). The remaining 20 percent are additives that serve numerous purposes, such as enhancing base oil properties, suppressing certain base oil properties, and adding new properties to the formulation. Usually, these additives are what distinctly separate one crankcase oil product from another. Crankcase oils protect engines by: Creating a thin layer of lubricating film between the metal surfaces that slide or roll against each other. This layer reduces friction and wear. Reducing the buildup of internal sludge and deposits. Transporting or dispersing contaminants such as dirt, sludge, soot, and metal particles. These contaminants are removed when the oil passes through the filters. Transferring the heat generated by the engine into the “cooler” oil circulation. Protecting metal surfaces from rust and corrosion. Improving fuel economy by decreasing friction between moving parts. Helping the oil pump deliver the correct value of oil more effectively by reducing the amount of bubbled air throughout the body of the oil and foam or froth. Conditioning engine seals to reduce leaks. Maintaining acceptable viscosities (thicknesses) for hot and cold operating temperatures. And you thought oil was only for lubrication! When you shop for motor oils, there are four group numbers as defined by the American Petroleum Institute (API). The groups (1 through 4) refer to how refined each product is — the most highly refined oils are API Group 4. Most often, you will see four types of oil on the shelf, and the API Group number assigned to each type depends on the particular product. The most common oil types (and their API Group numbers) are: Conventional. Conventional base oils are generally classified as API Group 2, which means they are highly refined from crude oil. In the past, we only used Group 1 motor oils, and a few conventional formulations as base oils. Now there are even further refined oils known as Group 3. Synthetic. Refiners manufacture synthetic oils using ethylene gas that is extracted from natural gas. Unlike the refined conventional base oils, synthetic oils are free of contaminants. These are mainly classified as Group 4 oils. Blends. Synthetic oil blends are made by combining oils from API Groups 2, 3, and 4. By definition, these blends cannot contain more than 30 percent synthetic oil. High-mileage. High-mileage motor oils are formulated for vehicles with 75,000 or more miles. These oils contain specific additives, including seal enhancers, to mitigate internal or external leaks often associated with older engines. Some of these additives work by causing the gaskets, O-rings, and other seals to swell slightly. Make sure to change oil and filters at the intervals the manufacturer recommends. If you wait to change the oil, it’s not a linear degradation. In other words, there is a sharp fall-off in engine oil performance. If you are a short-trip driver, it is probably beneficial to change the oil more frequently. If you are a long-haul driver, you can extend the oil change somewhat. If the vehicle is newer you can extend it. If the vehicle is older, then it will require more frequent oil changes. Many factors influence an oil’s life expectancy, but at the end of the day, you need to change the oil and filter at timely intervals to avoid permanent engine damage. Temperature determines how easily an oil will flow through an engine and the thickness of the oil lubricating films. The temperature inside a gasoline or diesel engine can reach 300ºF or greater for brief moments. This is important, because at higher temperatures, oils get thin and flow more like water. In fact, the oil can get so thin that it cannot provide the oil-film thickness that separates the two moving surfaces it is trying to protect. Most parts need to basically “hydroplane,” just as worn tires on a wet pavement do. Engines need a minimum viscosity to achieve the separation between parts, but the specific viscosity engines need is based on the specific parts, engines, temperatures, speed, and loading. When it’s cold, oil can thicken and flow more like molasses. When you start an engine under these cold conditions, the oil residue that is protecting your engine components is what was left when you last turned off the engine. When you start an engine in cold weather, there is a brief moment when fresh oil from the oil pan does not flow and circulate in all zones of the engine. It takes more time for the oil to move from the oil pan to fill some vacated cavities, lines, and components that might have been drained slowly while the engine was at rest. During start up, there might be metal-on-metal contact — there may be even more if you are using the wrong oil. This is called a dry start condition, and is the source of a high percentage of all engine wear. This is why manufacturers recommend that you do not operate your cold engine at a high RPM until the engine oil pressure gauge rises and stabilizes for several seconds. Whether they have fleet vehicles or tractors, many operators will test their oil to see if they contain any antifreeze, soot, fuel, chrome, or other contaminants that can damage the engine and affect oil performance. What you find in an oil sample analysis allows you to determine whether to change your engine oil and filters earlier or later based on the oil’s condition. You can also use test results to identify a potential problem before it becomes a costly one. For example, if a test reveals that the oil contains chrome, then that may indicate abnormal wear with bearings. Contact your oil supplier to determine if they will test oil or recommend someone who can. Engineers measure how an engine oil flows across a range of operating temperatures by assigning it a Viscosity Index (VI) rating. Viscosity measures the time it takes for oil to flow through a standard opening such as an orifice or capillary. Left unaltered, an oil can flow like water (low viscosity) when it is at high temperatures, or it can flow like syrup (high viscosity) when it is at cold temperatures. Think of pouring honey after letting it sit in the refrigerator overnight. The honey will thicken to the point that it barely moves when you turn the jar upside down. If you put the same honey in a microwave and heat it up for a minute, it will flow like water. Petroleum engineers and chemists formulate oils to accomplish two major goals: 1. To be thick enough to provide a lubricating film at hot temperatures 2. To be thin enough at cold temperatures to move quickly from the oil pan into and through the engine’s moving parts They can accomplish these goals by using additives called viscosity index improvers in engine oils. Synthetic lubricants require fewer of these additives, because they have naturally high VIs. The higher the VI, the less viscosity changes with the temperature. A Consumers Union study examined the differences between conventional and synthetic oils in New York City taxi cabs. Half the taxis used conventional motor oil, the other half used synthetic oils. The researchers changed the oil in all taxis at the regular scheduled maintenance intervals. All taxis were driven for 100,000 miles, and then the researchers evaluated the internal engine parts for wear or deposits. The researchers concluded that there were no differences in wear between the engines that used conventional oils and those that used synthetic oils as long as the taxis received their routine oil changes. There is a consensus that synthetic motor oils may help under extreme conditions — such as when owners do not regularly change filters and oils. Another scenario is when the engine coolant may be weak. These and other extreme conditions might be instances when synthetic oils could outperform a conventional motor oil. Under normal maintenance, driving, and operating conditions, the study concluded there are little differences between conventional and synthetic motor oil. When you look at engine oil labels, there are two items to look for: 1. The SAE grade 2. The API service rating The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) created a numerical numbering system that converts the common units of viscosity (centistoke, cSt) to a numerical system that describes the oil’s grade. Thicker oils have higher viscosity ratings. In practice, the higher the viscosity rating, the higher the SAE number will be for that oil. The SAE ratings move in steps (not linearly). You can easily find the SAE grade on a circular emblem that’s generally on the back of a container label. In the center of the emblem is the viscosity grade, which is the same number found on the front of the oil container. In the photo shown on this page, the SAE grade is 5W-30. The first part of an SAE number (such as 5W) is sometimes called the front number. The W in the front number does not stand for “weight” (as many people often refer to it). Rather, the W is an abbreviation that indicates the oil’s wintertime viscosity. The first number in the SAE grade (sometimes called the front number) has nothing to do with how tight the engine is built or the tolerances. But the back number has everything to do with both of those factors. The first number is the start-up viscosity in cold weather. Once the engine thermostat opens, the back number is the viscosity that is protecting the engine. The first number in the SAE grade (sometimes called the front number) has nothing to do with how tight the engine is built or the tolerances. But the back number has everything to do with both of those factors. The first number is the start-up viscosity in cold weather. Once the engine thermostat opens, the back number is the viscosity that is protecting the engine. In an SAE number, the front number is between 0W and 25W (OW, 5W, 10W, 15W, 20W, and 25W). The smaller the front number, the thinner the oil is at colder temperatures, which allows the engine to crank more easily and the oil to flow more readily. The part of the SAE number that follows the W is called the back number. The back number is the SAE viscosity grade at higher operating temperatures (defined as 210ºF). There are eight oil viscosity ratings for these higher temperatures: 8, 12, 16, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60. The higher the back number, the thicker the oil remains at the higher temperatures, which can protect engine parts against wear from friction. In short, an oil is often assigned two viscosities that depend on temperature. Oils that have these two viscosities are called “multi-grade” oils. The oil will have a lower viscosity rating at cold temperatures (for engine startup) and behave as an oil with a higher viscosity at hot temperatures for better coating and protection of moving parts in the engine. Any oil will still flow easier as the temperature increases, even though the winter value is lower than the second value. In order to assign the two values (for instance, 5W-30), lubricant formulators test the oil extensively to verify that it meets the requirements of both a 5W at colder temperatures and 30 oil at warmer temperatures. These tests go way beyond common viscosity measurements. Now, let’s compare the numbers that follow the W (the back number). It should now make sense that an SAE-rated 5W-30 motor oil has the same viscosity of a 10W-30 oil at higher temperatures. The difference between these two oils is that the 5W-30 is thinner at colder temperatures than the 10W-30 oil. A 10W-30 oil will perform like an SAE 10W oil at lower temperatures, while the 5W-30 will perform more like an SAE 5W oil. Most engines require multi-grade oil because of extreme engine temperatures (cold or hot). However, many pieces of equipment (such as lawn mower engines) can easily use an oil with a single grade of oil (such as SAE-30). These single grade oils are recommended when internal temperatures do not vary much between the highest and lowest temperatures, or when the engine is mostly used in warm weather when ambient temperatures are not as cold. Let’s look at a real example. Say that you drive a pickup truck for your daily driving. The owner’s manual recommends that you use a 5W-20 oil. But you begin to regularly pull a trailer with a heavy load. Under these conditions, the owner’s manual might recommend a 5W-30 oil. Can you now explain why? The answer is that you need a heavy oil when the engine is working harder, which in turn will lead to higher internal temperatures of the engine. Many owner’s manuals for both vehicles and for small engines (like lawn mowers) include tables to help you pick the correct oil weight based on climate and expected use. “That 5W-30 oil is too thin. Instead, let’s use the 10W-30 motor oil.” The back number (30) is the same on both oils, which means they have the same viscosity at higher temperatures as oils tend to thin. What’s wrong is that the two oils perform the same at high temperatures. The circular emblem on the back of a motor oil container will also contain the American Petroleum Institute (API) Service Classification. The API code forms the top of the circle. As engine technology has advanced, the oils they require had to change to meet temperature, tolerances, and metals used in their construction. In addition, manufacturers now incorporate additives into the oil for better performance. There are two general categories of an API service rating: 1. S for spark-ignited or service engines for cars and trucks that use gasoline. 2. C for compression-ignited diesel engines. Never use an API oil classified for a gasoline engine (S) into a diesel engine, because they do not have the additives diesel engines require. It is best to stick with the oil designed for gasoline engines at least as long as the equipment or vehicle is under warranty. Some lubricants are formulated for both. For diesel engine oils, the first oils were API coded CA, and they have evolved to CK. After the letter will be a number, typically a 4 or 2. The 4 indicates a 4-stroke engine while a 2 indicates a 2-stroke engine. We do not recommend after-market additives for engine oils without first checking with your engine manufacturer. If the formulators would have felt there was a need for additional additives and chemistries, they would have added them to the engine oil to begin with. What’s more, additives could void vehicle and equipment warranties. Many operators never give the oil filter a second thought — as if it isn't very important to an engine. It’s common to replace the used engine oil with a high-quality oil, then turn around and pick the cheapest filter possible. Some even try to save money by replacing the filter every other oil change. So, it might come as a surprise that if you had to choose between buying a better oil or a better filter, it is often better to spend money on a better filter. Remember that the main purpose of oil is to coat metal parts that move. While oil circulates throughout the engine, it will pick up small pieces of debris that can wedge into narrow gaps. The debris that lodges between moving parts can pit and abrade metal. This circumvents the protection the oil is supposed to provide. The oil and filter must work together to protect the engine from these microscopic, abrasive metal flakes that are by-products of combustion, dirt, and dust. If you install a less effective filter, or leave a filter on too long, it can be just as bad as operating an engine with oil past its prime. An under performing filter can negate the protection a premium oil provides, and so accelerate engine wear, affect reliability, and diminish service life. The takeaway message is that an oil’s ability to protect the moving parts in an engine from wear is only as good as the filter and its ability to remove contaminants from that oil. The filter capture efficiency measures how effectively the filter removes debris from oil. A filter also has to have enough holding capacity to retain all the debris until the next oil and filter change. Vehicles that operate in dusty environments might be better off with filters that have considerably higher dirt-holding capacity or those operators might change filters more frequently. To better understand how a filter removes and retains particles, it’s important to understand the filter’s design and how oil moves in and out of the canister. The filter is located between the oil pump and engine. When the engine is running, it first pulls oil from the bottom of the oil pan through a wire cloth strainer, and then pumps it to the filter. Once to the filter, the oil will pass under pressure through the smaller inlet port that forms a concentric circle around the opening at the top of the filter. Most oil filters have an outside to inside flow. Oil starts on the outside of the pleated filter elements and flows inward to the center tube. The pleated filter medium can be made of paper, glass fibers, or a blend of both. Inside the filter, the oil follows the path of least resistance — it first goes through the largest pores of the filter paper (media) and into the perforated center tube. Over time, as the larger pores become blocked, the oil is forced through smaller pores until all of the pores are plugged. The filtered oil will exit through the center port and on to the engine through a series of manifolds to reach different parts of the engine. Oil then flows down into the pan by gravity where it begins the journey again. A mechanical adaptation built into engines is to reroute the oil flow when the filter gets clogged. There is a fail-safe bypass value on the engine block just in case the flow is severely reduced from a clogged filter. This allows oil to continually flow even when the filter is plugged. It’s important to remember that the oil lubricating the engine will be unfiltered when it is in this bypass mode. It’s true that oil moving through a filter is more or less universal, but that doesn't mean all filters are created equal when it comes to capturing and retaining debris from the oil. How efficient an oil filter is can vary sharply between manufacturers, and even between brands offered by a single company (in other words, budget-priced filters and high-performance filters). One thing is certain: Just because you see the filter described as “deluxe,” “high-performance,” “super-efficient,” or just “darn good” it doesn't mean you’re getting a premium product. There are two criteria that influence oil filter performance and cost: 1. Dirt-holding capacity 2. Capture efficiency Both of these properties are determined when the filter is tested using ISO 4548-12—Methods of Test for Full-flow Lubricating Oil Filters for Internal Combustion Engines. This ISO testing procedure provides important details that allow us to make side-by-side comparisons of different filters. A filter’s dirt-holding capacity defines how long the filter will function before it goes into bypass mode. Filters used with synthetic oils that are rated for 15,000 miles will obviously stay in use longer, so they must be able to hold more than a filter that is designed to be replaced at intervals of 3,000 or 5,000 miles. When you purchase or select a filter, one approach is to buy a filter that is rated for the miles you expect to drive between oil changes with sufficient margin for error. Don’t forget to consider dusty conditions when looking at a filter (if it will be dusty, there will be more dirt to collect). Another approach is to find out how much debris the filter can trap. The ISO test measures the grams of debris the filter can collect before it no longer functions. You'll find large differences between filters that can capture 14 grams of dirt and those that can capture 28 grams. A filter that can hold twice the amount of debris is often more expensive. During the ISO test, technicians progressively introduce laboratory test dust upstream of the filter. They monitor oil pressure, which will rise slightly as the filter loads with dirt. Once it reaches the terminal pressure drop (determined by the filter maker), they terminate the test. They calculate the total amount of dirt removed by the filter from the total amount that they introduced. Another important measure of oil filter quality is known as the beta ratio. This measure describes the filter’s particle capture efficiency at different sizes. Manufacturers use different average pore sizes for the filter’s media. The media require finer pore sizes to remove the smaller, micron-sized particles. Those finer pores can be more expensive than coarser media that have larger pores. The test conditions for determining the beta ratio are the same as the conditions for the capture efficiency. The two tests occur at the same time. During the test (done on a laboratory test stand), oil flows from the test reservoir though the filter and back to the same reservoir. While technicians add the controlled stream of laboratory test dust, a pair of special sensors (called particle counters) are positioned upstream and downstream of the filter. Because the filter removes particles of various sizes, the concentration of particles that are upstream of the filter will always be higher than the concentration downstream. The beta ratio is the ratio of these two concentrations: For any given particle size (such as 10 micrometers) the higher the beta ratio, the better the filter’s capture efficiency. For instance, if ten particles greater than 10 microns (micrometers) are counted upstream of the filter and only one of these particles is counted downstream, then the beta ratio is 10 (10/1). You can convert the Beta Ratio to efficiency as: The beta ratio and the capture efficiency have no value unless we know precisely the size of the microns being evaluated in the test (10 microns for instance). Working film clearance between the piston ring and cylinder wall in engines is extremely small — maybe as little as 10 microns. Debris in the 10-micron range can cut or scratch metal as the particles roll between opposing surfaces. Particles larger than 10 microns will not fit into the smaller gaps and will be swept aside. Smaller particles will generally flow through the gap with the oil. Consider that a standard oil filter removes particles that are larger than 40 microns. It’s been demonstrated that particles that average 10 microns can produce four times more wear on rods, rings, and bearings than particles larger than 20 microns. Can you see the problem? General Motors reported that a filter that captures 30-micron particles or larger reduced engine wear by 50 percent over a 40-micron filter. A 15-micron filter reduces engine wear by 70 percent over a 40-micron filter. This is why experts often measure and report capture efficiency based on how well the filter removes 10-micron particles or larger. It is worth noting that this performance property is a large component of the premium price you’re paying for high-end filtration. Back to the capture efficiency. A filter that has a 95 percent capture efficiency of particles larger than 20 microns means it will remove 95 percent of particles that are equal to or larger than 20 microns on a single pass. Experts generally agree that an oil filter should have a beta ratio of 100, which is a 99 percent capture efficiency for 10-micron or larger particles (100-1/100 = .99 x 100 = 99%; see Table 1). Unlike the markings on an oil container, finding information about a filter’s beta ratio and capture efficiency is often difficult to locate on the filter’s package or manufacturer’s website. Most likely, you will have to ask the supplier for the capture efficiency and beta ratio of the filters you purchase. But the answer to this single question could greatly prolong the life of your equipment. It goes without saying that we all need to dispose of used oil and oil filters so that we do not contaminate land or water. One quart of oil has the potential to contaminate up to 250,000 gallons of drinking water or produce an oil film over a 2-acre pond. With the high risk for affecting water, mismanaging used oil drained from an engine or oil remaining in a filter or jug is not an option. Always completely drain oil containers and filters before dispensing of them in in the trash. Everyone should store used oil for proper disposal. The key to properly managing oil filters is to completely drain them before disposal. The oil and filters you choose greatly affect your equipment’s reliability and life expectancy. If you intend to run equipment to the end of its useful life or extend its normal service life, then you really need to educate yourself about the oils and filters you use in that equipment. Consider the money you have invested in purchasing trucks, sprayers, mowers, planters, combines, and other equipment. That investment should convince you that knowing more about the oils and filters you use to protect that equipment is a high priority. You can go cheap and save money now. But in the long run, it may cost more when your equipment breaks down and is prematurely damaged due to the wrong oil or and under performing filter. You can just as easily overspend on exotic oils and fancy oil filters that deliver little return on investment — or the benefit will only be gained by the next owner of the equipment after you sell it. This is why it is important to remember: Select lubricants more on what the lubricant is designed to do rather than its cost. Think performance first, price second. By making better selections, you should expect increased fuel economy, lessened emissions, and extended life expectancy of equipment. Oils have come a long way since the 1960s. They last longer and maintain their viscosity better under strenuous conditions. But choosing the wrong oil for the wrong application can be costly. Read the owner’s manual for your vehicle to be sure you purchase oil, and realize what all the numbers on the jug of oil mean before you dump just any old oil into your equipment. Going cheap and saving money in the short run may cost you big in the long run! Acknowledgments Thanks to Dawn Minns for graphic design.

    "title": "Answers to Your Questions on Automotive Lubricants",
    "content": "Over the course of the past few months, I have been instructing on-site machinery lubrication courses at what seems like a rate of one a week. Inevitably during a course, I will get multiple questions about automotive lubricants. I’ve decided to dedicate this article to answering some of the more popular questions that I get. The first thing we need to understand is the mechanics of the automotive lubricating system. The system is designed to deliver clean oil to each individual component in the engine. It does this by first pulling the oil from the sump (oil pan) and into the pump. The pump then forces the oil through the oil filter and pressure-feeds the main bearings and oil galleyways. From the main bearings, the oil passes through feedholes that have been drilled into the crankshaft and onto the bearings of the connecting rod. The cylinder walls, piston pin and upper connecting rod bearings are all lubricated by the flinging of the oil as the crank rotates. The pressurized oil galleyways are responsible for the lubrication of the cam bearings, lifters, springs, timing chain and gears. The lubricant has two primary roles to play. One is to control friction and wear. It does this by separating the two interacting machine surfaces with a film. Instead of having harsh metal-on-metal contact (known as a boundary condition), the lubricant provides a film that reduces the friction – in some cases, many thousands of times. Another important role is temperature control. Heat is generated at the interaction point between the components. The lubricant is able to absorb this heat, carry it away from the component and dissipate it in the sump or in a cooler. The lubricant used in today’s technology-advanced machines has to be very special. The American Petroleum Institute (API) has a program to certify that oil can meet the strict performance and quality standards put in place by the OEM. The service rating is shown in the API “Service Symbol Donut” on the product label. There also may be an “API Certified for Gasoline Engines” seal on the label. Figure 1. API Oil Service Ratings The newest service category rating for gasoline engines in 2011 model year cars and light trucks is “SN.” The API SN rating is equivalent to the new GF-5 oil rating by the International Lubricant Standardization and Approval Committee (ILSAC). SN engine oils are designated as Resource Conserving because they help improve fuel economy and protect vehicle emission system components. These oils have demonstrated a fuel economy improvement in the Sequence VID test when compared with a baseline oil used in the Sequence VID test. Additionally, these oils have demonstrated in tests that they provide greater emission system and turbocharger protection and help protect engines when operating on ethanol-containing fuels up to E85. Oils that meet the new SN and GF-5 motor oil ratings are designed to improve fuel economy, improve the life of emission components (such as the catalytic converter and oxygen sensors), and improve sludge, deposit and oxidation control. The oils also have better low-temperature viscosity, high- and low-temperature corrosion protection, better turbocharger protection, and improved filter-clogging protection. The new SN and GF-5 rated motor oils are backward compatible, and may be used in 2010 and older engines. For diesel engines, API has a separate rating system. The current category is “CJ-4” (introduced in 2007 for newer diesels that have exhaust gas recirculation). The previous CI-4 (2002), CH-4 (1998) CG-4 (1995) and CF-4 (1990) categories all can be used in older four-stroke diesel engines. CF-2 (1994) is the API classification for two-stroke diesels. So, what should you be looking for when you go to buy engine oil? Let me point it out for you. The first thing is that you want to be sure and find the “API starburst”. The API Certification Mark (the starburst symbol at right) tells consumers if an oil meets the most up-to-date requirements for passenger vehicles as outlined in the latest ILSAC specification. Oils that carry the API Certification Mark are energy-conserving and are suitable for all previous model years. The mark must be displayed on the front of licensed motor oil product packaging. The next thing you want to consider is the service category. As previously mentioned, it is part of the API “donut” symbol (seen below). The Service category (top of the donut) should be that which your owner’s manual states, or newer. The viscosity (center of the donut) should be consistent with the manual as well. The bottom half tells whether the oil has demonstrated energy-conserving properties in a standard test in comparison to reference oil. If you can follow these simple steps and purposefully look for the proper markings, oil selection is quite easy. You will have to train your eye to look past the fancy marketing, colorful packaging and gimmicks. It’s what is written on the packaging that is of real importance."

    "title": "6 Signs Your Car's Oil Needs Changing",
    "content": "Changing the oil in your car is usually a quick and painless procedure when performed at a modern automotive service center. Lubricating oil in your vehicle is something that is vitally important to its well-being. Good, clean oil improves the performance of your car and extends the life of the engine, so why do many people delay in replacing their oil until there’s a visible problem? A lot of drivers rely solely on mileage as a gauge of when their oil needs to be replaced, but other factors come into play as well, such as the quality of the oil, the age of the car and how the car is driven. Fresh, clean oil optimizes your vehicle’s performance by lubricating parts and keeping the engine clean and healthy. However, over time, the fluid breaks down and has difficulty performing its duties. Once this begins, your car likely will exhibit at least one of the warning signs below. The most obvious alert that there’s an issue with your oil will come from the car itself. The oil change light in your vehicle will illuminate when there’s not enough oil in the system, so check the dipstick to see what’s happening. In worse cases, the check engine light will illuminate. This is your car warning you that things have gotten so bad that the engine is at risk of damage due to problem parts or lack of lubrication. Oil provides a protective layer between engine parts, avoiding metal-to-metal brushing and keeping the engine quiet. If your oil isn’t doing its job properly, the engine noise will increase. In severe cases, you may even hear knocking or rumbling sounds that signify your engine is tearing itself apart bit by bit through lack of lubrication. Clean oil is amber in color and slightly translucent. As it is used, it becomes filled with particles collected from the engine and turns darker. It will not be obvious when this begins to happen, so you must be vigilant and check your engine oil at least once a month. To do this, remove the dipstick and wipe it off before returning it to the oil tank. Now take it out a second time. If you cannot see the dipstick through the oil, it is time for an oil change. If you smell oil inside the car, it can often signify an oil leak. If you also smell gas or exhaust fumes, the vehicle may be overheating. Either way, you will want to schedule maintenance immediately. Some translucent vapor will always come out of your car’s tailpipe, but if this changes to smoke, it’s time for an engine check-up. You may have faulty engine parts or an oil leak. If you’ve traveled a lot of miles in the last month, consider whether you need an oil change sooner than your normal schedule. Every car is different, but most should have their oil changed every 3,000 miles or three months. New vehicles usually require a change of oil every 6,000 miles or six months. Check your owner’s handbook for specific guidelines. Consider a high-mileage oil for older vehicles. Oil changes are simple and inexpensive, and one of the most important things you can do to keep your car from aging prematurely. Having the right level and quality of oil will prevent excessive wear and tear on your engine, ultimately resulting in fewer repairs down the road."

    "title": "10 Tips for a Successful Oil Change",
    "content": "One of the most common do-it-yourself car maintenance jobs is the classic oil change. A simple process, yes, but it is always important to refresh your memory, so you fully understand what it takes to have a completely successful oil change. And if you have never changed your own oil before, welcome! We hope this guide can become handy in your learning and understanding on how to change your car’s oil. Every vehicle is different when it comes to oil changes. From the type of oil needed, quantity or blend, it is crucial to double-check your manufacturer’s guidelines regarding these specifics. For example, if you put the wrong oil in your car, it can lead to reduced lubrication and an overall shorter engine lifespan. Take the extra time to research exactly what your car needs. All engines have specific oil weights that should be used in each particular engine. This varies by make and model, but most modern cars have the weight printed on the oil fill cap under the hood. If not, there may be a small sticker that identifies what your engine requires. The weight of your oil should always be matched with the one recommended by the manufacture. No exceptions. You can read more about the different types of motor oils on our blog here. When changing your oil at home, it is imperative that you have the correct protective gear and supplies to ensure a safe, clean, and stress-free oil change. It is a good idea to wear rubber gloves and have plenty of clean towels handy to quickly remove any oil you may come in contact with. Also, we recommend using a tarp, old shower curtain, or something similar to lay underneath the oil pan in order to protect your driveway from nasty spills. This is important whenever you conduct any type of work – big or small – on your vehicle. If you have recently driven your car, it is important to let it sit for 20-30 minutes to ensure the oil does not burn you. Yes, it flows freely when warm but can cause serious damage if your skin comes in contact with it. If you want to warm up the oil, you can run your car for 2 minutes to get the oil warmed up to flow easily, but not enough to cause harm. Of course, you aren’t going to let your oil drain freely into your hands or onto the ground – you need a drain pan! These are easy to find at any auto store and will ensure that your oil can drain safely and securely. Some drain pans, such as the funnel-top drain pan, fully cover the oil, limiting the chance of a disastrous spill. Some also feature reinforced handles that help with transporting the dirty oil. Oil filters can be very difficult to remove, especially if your hands are covered in oil. At your local auto store, you will also notice an array of tools to help with your oil change. We love gripping oil change tools that can help you remove any stubborn oil filters. From clamp-style to 3-jaw adjustable wrenches, there are a variety of styles and options to fit your needs and budget. One of the most common oil-changing mistakes is not letting the new oil filter dry. When the new filter is put back on wet, it results in a poor seal that can lead to loose-fitting and leaky filters. After some time, the filter may even unthread itself, leaving your car’s oil all over your driveway. Always make sure to fill the filter about halfway with oil and then spread a tiny bit around the filter to ensure a perfect seal. Easier said than done for most oil-changing novices, ensure that all your oil goes into the engine – not on it. Ensuring you are using an effective funnel and pouring the oil at the correct angle will help with this. Always make sure to turn the spout so that it is at the top, over the funnel, and begin to pour slowly. This helps ensure air does not cause the oil to spurt and gurgle when being poured into the engine. Used engine oil should always be disposed of properly and responsibly – no ifs, and, or buts. Not only is this better for the environment, but some states also have laws regarding how used oil must be disposed of. Many local auto shops may be able to take this oil off your hands, which ensures the oil is properly recycled. Your engine’s dipstick is important in your overall car’s maintenance and oil changes. Usually identifiable via a bright yellow ring, your dipstick tells you exactly what your engine’s oil level is. After pulling it out, wipe it off with a rag or cloth, then reinsert, this time pulling out and identifying the marking on the dipstick. It’s important to check your dipstick after every bottle of oil. Once your dipstick tells you your oil is at the appropriate level, be sure to check your dipstick again after a few miles of use. This will identify any potential oil leaks you may have. What could go wrong with my DIY oil change? There’s a reason why auto professionals are paid to do them. Many mistakes can occur when changing your own oil at home and should be considered before trying it yourself. Some possible issues that may arise include: For over 30 years, the auto repair experts at Christian Brothers Automotive have offered quality care and maintenance services for your vehicle, including full-service oil changes.

    "title": "Four Common Services Offered at Auto Repair Centers",
    "content": "Car trouble can be hard to face, especially when it catches you by surprise. We’ve all been there. We take our car to the shop for one thing, and the shop finds something completely different. Then, we receive the bad news along with the price tag that comes with that bad news. It’s understandable to feel attacked, singled out, or even like the shop is trying to take advantage of you. Since 1982, the team at Christian Brothers Automotive has been helping car owners from all corners of the country keep up on their regularly scheduled maintenance as well as recover from other unexpected problems through reliable, trustworthy, and professional repair. Due to our decades of experience, it’s safe to say that we’ve seen our fair share of problems and have developed knowledge of the most common repairs. Whether you’re trying to understand why your vehicle isn’t driving as smoothly as it used to or why your check engine light has popped on, knowing the most common automotive repairs performed can give you some reassurance that it truly does happen to everyone. Nearly every single one of us can expect to face these four common repairs, and it will probably happen sooner than later. Your oil is used every time your car is driven and will become dirty over time. Replacing the oil and filter every six months will help your vehicle avoid damage, keep things lubricated, and ensure peak performance wherever you need to go! This is number one because it’s the most common preventive maintenance and repair there is. Waiting too long past your windshield’s oil change sticker reminder, ignoring that yellow wrench icon on your dashboard, or until your engine begins knocking or smoking is always a bad idea. If you do, you’ll need a number of other not-so-common repairs done to your car – a truly sad day for your wallet. Sometimes your car might feel like it’s tugging to one side, leaving you fighting to drive it in a straight line. If this sounds familiar, something in your car is misaligned. Lucky for you, this is a very easy fix. Bringing your car into our local auto repair shop is your best bet for a wheel alignment service. While this may be a minor inconvenience now and something you don’t think is worth bringing your car in for, the problem will not simply go away. If left unattended, alignment problems can cause significant damage to your tires, suspension system, and other vital parts, which, again, are expensive, not-so-common repairs. It doesn’t take long for tires to get worn down or need repairs—after all, they’re the main contact to the road. Tire services, including tire rotation, patching, or replacing, are common auto shop repairs that are quick and easy to find. To help prevent damage to your tires, ensure even wear, and promote efficient driving, tire rotation is crucial, so it's vital to know when you should be servicing your tires. Your brakes are obviously a very important part of your car. Without them, you probably wouldn’t want to drive anywhere – because you couldn’t stop! It’s possibly the highest ranking safety aspect of your car. Having brake services performed, such as brake repair, a fluid flush, and brake pad and rotor replacement, is critical. Additionally, scheduling regular tests to double-check the performance of your car’s brake system can save you from having trouble down the road. Our vehicle maintenance experts will gladly give your car a test drive and evaluate the condition of your braking system.

    "title": "Make Sure You're Getting Quality Auto Parts",
    "content": "When you visit your local auto repair shop for repair or maintenance, you want to make sure you're getting good service and confident that the parts being used for your vehicle are of high quality. After all, your car's performance and safety largely depend on its parts' quality. A short-term savings on a less expensive, low-quality auto part can put your car back in the shop sooner than you expected—and cost you more down the road. Christian Brothers Automotive explains why choosing quality auto parts for your vehicle is important. Auto parts fall into two categories: original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and aftermarket. Car parts made by a specific car manufacturer are classified as OEM car parts, and aftermarket parts are defined as any vehicle part not sourced from the car’s maker. Both groups of auto parts offer pros and cons—either can be a good choice, depending on the particular situation and part type. When you choose an OEM auto part, the selection is straightforward—directly from your car’s maker. You can also count on greater quality assurance overall and a full warranty. However, OEM parts are traditionally more expensive. It’s a common myth that OEM parts can only be purchased through a dealership – auto shops like Christian Brothers Automotive can also supply these parts. While aftermarket parts can sometimes be an option, there are specific critical components where sticking with OEM is strongly recommended. These include: Choosing OEM parts for these crucial components helps ensure your vehicle remains safe, reliable, and performs at its best, ultimately saving you time and money on future repairs. Aftermarket parts are typically less expensive, and the quality has the possibility of being equal or greater compared to an OEM part when you choose a trusted brand. Aftermarket products are also more widely accessible than OEM parts, which can be an advantage when you need to get back on the road quickly. Aftermarket parts are an excellent option for non-critical components. These include: Choosing aftermarket parts can be a cost-effective option for non-critical parts. Still, it's important to research and choose reputable brands to ensure quality and compatibility with your vehicle. The availability of warranties for aftermarket parts depends on the brand and supplier. Some aftermarket parts come with warranties, while others do not. It's essential to check with the specific brand or supplier to determine if a warranty covers the part you are purchasing. If you opt for a direct replacement part designed to fit and function just like the original, it shouldn't void your vehicle's warranty under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. However, if the aftermarket part causes damage or contributes to a failure, the manufacturer may deny warranty coverage for that specific issue. With the convenience and cost savings of online shopping, purchasing auto parts online is tempting. However, be cautious when considering this option. While you may find a lower price, there's no guarantee that the part will be of good quality or even compatible with your vehicle. Purchasing from a reputable local repair shop not only ensures you're getting quality parts but also the expertise and support of experienced mechanics who can help with installation and any potential issues. To minimize this risk of any potential issues, it’s best to seek trusted professionals like Christian Brothers Automotive when looking for quality auto parts and installation. With our experienced mechanics and high-quality parts, you can trust that your vehicle will perform at its best after any repair or maintenance service. We'll also back things up with our Nice Difference® Warranty, offering 3-year or 36,000-mile protection on most parts and labor. This gives you peace of mind knowing that your vehicle is in good hands and that we stand behind the quality of our work and parts. Trust Christian Brothers Automotive for all your auto part needs.

    "title": "6 Warning Signs Your Fuel Filter Needs Replacement",
    "content": "Your vehicle's fuel system is a complex network of components working together to keep your engine running smoothly. Among these components, the fuel filter plays a crucial but often overlooked role. Understanding what it does and maintaining it properly can help prevent costly repairs and keep your vehicle performing at its best. At Christian Brothers Automotive, we know the importance of a well-maintained fuel system, so we offer expert fuel filter replacement and maintenance services. But before we get into that, let's dive into what exactly a fuel filter is and why it's important. Think of your fuel filter as your car's bouncer—it screens out unwanted contaminants before they can enter your engine. Just as a bouncer keeps troublemakers out of a club, your fuel filter prevents harmful particles from reaching vital engine components. The fuel filter is typically located between your fuel tank and the engine integrated into the fuel line. Its primary job is to capture and contain contaminants like: Inside the filter, a specially designed membrane catches these particles while allowing clean fuel to flow through. This filtering process is essential because even tiny contaminants can damage expensive engine components like fuel injectors, which require precise tolerances to operate effectively. Like any filter, your fuel filter has a limited capacity for trapping contaminants. Over time, it becomes saturated and less effective at its job. While manufacturer recommendations vary, most suggest replacing your fuel filter every 20,000 to 30,000 miles. However, several factors can affect this interval: Drivers who frequently fill up at low-quality gas stations or operate in dusty conditions may need more frequent replacements. For guidance specific to your vehicle, it's always best to consult your owner's manual or a trusted technician. Like every component of your vehicle, fuel filters can also experience issues over time. Some of the most common problems with fuel filters include: If you're experiencing any of these issues, having your fuel filter inspected and replaced is essential. Neglecting a faulty fuel filter can lead to more significant problems with your vehicle's fuel system and potentially leave you stranded on the side of the road. Your vehicle will usually let you know when the fuel filter needs attention. Here are common warning signs to watch for: Struggling to Start: Your engine will crank longer than normal before starting, especially on cold mornings. Unlike a failing fuel pump's intermittent issues, this symptom steadily worsens over time. Loss of Power: You'll notice reduced power during acceleration or hill climbing, as the restricted filter can't meet increased fuel demands. The sensation feels like driving with a partially pressed brake pedal. Engine Stumbling: When your engine can't get consistent fuel flow, it stumbles or hesitates during acceleration. Unlike sporadic ignition problems, these symptoms are predictable and worsen under increased engine load. Poor Fuel Economy: Fuel efficiency decreases as your fuel pump works harder to push fuel through the restricted filter. This change appears gradually in your mileage tracking, particularly during city driving. Stuttering Under Load: Your engine will exhibit a consistent stuttering or bucking sensation during acceleration or climbing hills. The issue typically smooths out at cruising speed. Check Engine Light: A clogged fuel filter may trigger check engine codes, particularly those related to lean running conditions (P0171/P0174) or low fuel pressure (P0087). However, these codes can indicate various fuel system issues, so a professional diagnosis is recommended. Of course, these symptoms are also common in other fuel system and engine problems, so it's essential to have your vehicle checked by a professional. Our team at Christian Brothers Automotive has the knowledge and experience to diagnose and resolve any fuel system issues you may be experiencing. While some DIY-minded owners might consider changing their fuel filters themselves, professional service ensures the job is done right. At Christian Brothers Automotive, our certified technicians have the expertise and equipment to properly assess and maintain your fuel filter. We use high-quality filters and adhere to manufacturer recommendations, ensuring your vehicle's long-term performance. Changing your fuel filter is just one part of keeping your vehicle's fuel system in top shape. Regular maintenance can also prevent issues like clogged injectors or a failing fuel pump. At Christian Brothers Automotive, we offer comprehensive fuel system services to keep your car running smoothly and efficiently.

To keep your engine in top condition, follow these essential oil change tips: Always use the oil type and viscosity recommended in your car’s manual to ensure optimal performance. Most synthetic oils last between 7,500 and 10,000 km, while mineral oils require changes every 3,000 to 5,000 km. Change your oil regularly to prevent engine wear and sludge buildup. Use the dipstick to check oil levels at least once a month. Low oil levels can lead to engine damage. Every time you change your oil, also replace the oil filter to ensure contaminants are properly filtered out. Adding too much oil can cause excessive pressure and damage engine seals. Always stick to the recommended oil capacity. Fresh engine oil is usually amber or light brown. If the oil turns dark and thick, it’s time for a change. Cheap, low-quality oils may contain impurities that can harm your engine. Always buy from reputable brands.
